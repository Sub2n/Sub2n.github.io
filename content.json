OOP and ADT","text":"Object-oriented DesignObject-oriented design has fundamnental defferences from structured programming design methods. The two methods are similar in that they develop complex systems with divide and conquer, but differ in how to divide a given task. Algorithmic Decomposition vs Object-oriented DecompositionTraditional programming techniques used to algoritmicc decomposition. Algorithmic or functional decomposition treats software as a process and breaks it down into modules that represent the steps of the process. These modules are implemented in language syntax such as procedure of Pascal, subprogram of FORTRAN, function in C. Data Structure to implement the program is of secondary concern and should be considered only after the project has been divided into functional modules. Object-oriented decomposition views software as set of Well-defined objects that model software well for entity in applications. These objects form software sysyem by interaction. Functional decomposition should be considered after system decomposied to objects. The majot positive of object-oriented design is reuse of software. This enables flexible software systems that can change and evolve as the requirements of the system change. Basic concept of Object-oriented ProgrammingDefinition : An object is an entity that performs calculations and has states. So object can be considered compination of data and operations. Definition : OOP has methods such as .. An object is basic building block. Each object is instance of some type(class). Classes are connected each other by inheritance. (Programming not using inheritance does not considered as object-oriented programming) Definition : Called object-oriented language if some language has a function like .. Support object All objects are involved in class Support inheritance A language support 1, 2 not 3 called “object-based language”. (JavaScript) Data Abstraction and EncapsulationThe concept of abstraction and encapsulation is used to human-machine interaction. Definition : Data encapsulation(or Information Hiding) hides the detailed implementation of data objects from the outside world. Definition : Data abstraction is the separation of specification and implementation of data objects. C++ has char, int, float, double as a default data type. These data types are modified if short, long, signed, unsigned keywords are used. All programming languages provide at least a minimum of predefined data types, plus the ability to create new user-defined types. Definition : Data type is set of objects and operations of that objects. Whatever program addresses default data type or user-defined data type, object and operation must be considered. Definition : ADT(Abstraction Data Type) is a data type in which the specifications of objects and the specifications of operations on these objects are separated from the representation of the objects and the implementation of the operations. To emphasize the separation of specification and implementation, the ADT definition of the object will begin first. In this way, people can understand the essential elements of an object without a complex description of the representation of the object and the actual implementation of the operation.

Comparing primitive and objects","text":"Difference between primitive type and object type Primitive Type Object Type immutable value mutable value stored as value itself stored as reference value (memory address of an object) Pass by value Pass by reference Primitive ValueImmutable Value The value of primitive type is an immutable value. (Read only, can not change) Can not change value doesn’t mean can not reassign value. Variable can be reassigned a new value, but the value can not be changed. When reassigning a new value to a variable, instead of changing the value stored in the memory space pointed to by the variable, assign a value to the new memory space and make the variable refer to the new memory space. This is because the primitive value is immutable. If the primitive value is a mutable value, the memory address referenced by the variable will not change when reassigning the variable. immutability : Since the primitive value is an immutable value, when the value of the variable is changed, the new value is stored in the new memory space, and the memory space is referred to. This property is called the immutability of the primitive value. Immutable? constant?In programming language, variable is a mechanism that store and refer data values. So, constant is also variable but can not assign more than once. Variables, and constants are memory spaces that can hold values, and the concept of mutable, immutable is about whether the value can change. 123456&gt; //Constants declared with the const keyword are not reassigned.&gt; const obj = {};&gt; &gt; obj.a = 1;&gt; console.log(obj); // {a: 1}&gt; Objects declared as const can be changed. This is because you are not reassigning a new object to const. That is, the constant is only a variable for which reassignment is prohibited. String and Immutability String is immutable because it’s also primitive type of JavaScript. String is an array-like object. Array-like ObjectAn array-like object is an object that is not an array, but can be treated like an array. A string can access each character through an index like an array, or it can be traversed by a for statement. This means that the string can be an object with a length property. You can not change str[0], but error doesn’t occur. Just ignore it. But, it is of course possible to reassign the new string. Because it is not a change to the existing string but a new assignment of the new string. The string gives the confidence that the value does not change without reassignment. Pass by valueWhat happens when a variable is assigned to a variable? If assigned variable is primitive type, the assigned variable value is copied and passed. It’s pass by value. 12var score = 80;var mine = score; Variable score and mine have a value 80, but it’s a separate value in memory. The value 80 in mine is not same as 80 in score. This is because the memory space of the variables mine and score is different and each contains a value. Thus, reassigning another value to the variable score does not affect the value of the variable mine. Object An object is a collection of properties consisting of key and value. A property whose value is a function is called a method. Since the number of properties is not fixed and the object can be added and deleted dynamically, the size of the memory space can not be preset in advance like the primitive value. How JavaScript manages objectsUnlike with an class-based object-oriented language, JavaScript can create an object without class and dynamically add a property and method even after an object have been created. For this reason, almost modern JavaScript engine uses a function-based dictionary-like structure to score a location of object property in memory. This is theoretically more costly and inefficient than object management in class-based object-oriented programming languages such as Java. So V8 JavaScript engine uses hidden class method. A hidden class operates like class in Java. Mutable ValueThe value of an object (reference) type, that is, an object is a mutable value. A variable that has been assigned a primitive value has its primitive value as its value. But, the variable that the object is assigned has a reference value as a value. The reference value is the address of the memory space in which the created object is stored, itself. 123var student = { name: 'Park'}; student variable has a address of the memory space where a created object is stored. This is a reference value. A variable can access the object by this reference value. When evaluating a variable that assigns an object, it returns the object by accessing the actual object through the reference value rather than returning the reference value stored in memory. An object pointed by a variable can be added dynamically after it has been created, updated, or deleted. In other words, an object is a mutable value. Objects can be very large and change fluidly, so instead of reallocating each time as a primitive value and changing the memory address, it changes the object itself to be referenced directly. In other words, copying an object as a primitive value (a deep copy) is expensive and inefficient, so it copies the reference value. Shallow copy and Deep copy Shallow copy : copying reference values Deep copy : copying and recreating the object itself as a primitive value. The larger the object, the higher the cost. A side effect of storing an object’s reference value is that an object can be referenced by multiple identifiers. 123456789var student = { name: 'Park'};var teacher = student;teacher.age = 35;console.log(teacher);console.log(student); The property is added only to the object of the teacher variable, but the changes are shared because the objects referenced by the student and teacher are the same. Pass by ReferenceIf you assign a variable that points to an object to another variable, the original reference value is copied and passed. This is called pass by reference. As shown in the figure above, since the memory address of the same object is referenced, student and teacher refer to the same object and change it.","link":"/2019/05/07/10-Comparing-primitive-and-objects/"},{"title":"1. What is Programming?","text":"1. Computational ThinkingProgramming is communication that sends commands to be performed to the computer. In order to define the “command to be performed,” the resolution task (problem/requirements) must be clearly understood, the complexity must be simply desconstructed, the data organized and sorted by modeling, and the actions arranged in sequence. In other words, clear understanding of reguirements and proper definitaion of solution are needed before programming. What is required at this time is the problem-solving skill. Some people tend to equate problem-solving abilities with algorithms, but it does not. Of course studying algorithm is very helpful to get problem-solving skill, but problem-solving skill is more higher level of ability. Programming is just a means of expression to produce the final result of solving a problem. Programming itself doesn’t solve the problem. Considering the solution of the problem, you should look at preoblem from a computer’s point of view. Computational thinking is required this kind of time. You should do computational thinking with solving problems. This requires logical and mathematical thinking, and all concepts that will be used within the programming should be defined as assessable, breaking down and patterning the resolution tasks into smaller units. 2. Programming LanguageAs above, solution defined based on problem-solving skill should be communicated to computer. At this point, computer do perform the commands. So the command should be communicated by machine code, not a natural language. But it is very difficult that human to understand machine code. It is even described in bits. The most useful alternative to delivering commands in direct mechanical language is to use a kind of translator to write a program using “programming language” consisting of promised phrases (Syntax) that humans can understand and then convert it into machine language that computers can understand. This kind of translator is called complier or interpreter. Programming is a kind of communication that sends commands to the computer that you want to perform using the programming language. The programming language is expressed as a combination of Syntax and Semantics. 3. Syntax &amp; SemanticsUnderstanding both syntax and semantics properly is important to use language well. In the end, solutions created through problem-solving ability are expressed through the syntax of programming languages. The code is a specific implementation of the solution. This is only archeive semantics when the requirements are fulfilled(problem solved). Most of programming languages provide syntax such as variables and values, keywords, operators, expressions, flow control by conditional and loop statements, statements, functions(set of statements), and data structures such as objects and arrays. What a programmer needs to do is find a solution for problem and implement it in a code that has correct syntax. Implemented code should act as expected and solve the problem. It should be predictable and explainable how the code work inside the computer and what it will give back. To do this, it is important to have an accurate understanding of the basic concepts and operating principles of programming language. If you just copy &amp; paste code without understand basic concept and principle, that code is not reliable. And problem-solving skills will not grow anymore.

A scope is a data structure that keeps the binding of identifiers and values, and is managed by the JavaScript engine. What is Scope?The range in which the variable is valid. That is, the extent to which other code can refer to the variable itself. The scope is created by the location where the variable is declared. When there are variables with the same name in different scopes, JavaScript engine must decide which variable to reference at runtime. JavaScript uses the scope to determine which variables to reference. That is, the scope is the rule that the JavaScript engine uses to search for variables to reference. By default, JavaScript supports function-level scopes rather than block-level scopes. Variables declared with var form a function-level scope. However, variables declared with let or const form a block-level scopes. If there is no scope, the name of the variable in the program should be unique. Duplicate declaration of var keyword variableVariables declared with the var keyword allow duplicate declarations within the same scope. 1234567891011&gt; function foo() {&gt; var x = 1; &gt; &gt; // This statement operates like x = 2;&gt; // So reassignment occurs.&gt; var x = 2; //2&gt; &gt; console.log(x); //2&gt; }&gt; foo();&gt; Variables declared as let or const do not allow duplicate declarations, so it is better to use them. Types of scopeCode can be distinguished as global and local. Global Local Explanation Outermost area of code Inside of function body Scope Global scope Local scope Vaiable Global variable Local variable The variable is determined by its declared location (global or local) to the scope in which it is valid. A variable declared in global is a global variable having a global scope A variable declared in local is a local variable having a local scope. Declaring a variable in global is a global variable with a global scope. Global variables can be referenced anywhere. In other words, global variables are valid in the global scope. Local variables can be referenced only in the declared region and sub-region (nested function). In other words, local variables are valid in their local and subregional scopes. Scope ChainScopes are created by functions. Functions can be nested, so the local scope of a function can also be nested. This means that the scope has a hierarchical structure by nesting of functions. The local scope of the outer function is the top scope of the nested function. The scope chain refers to a structure in which the scopes from the deepest local scope to the global scope of the overlap are hierarchically connected. When referring to a variable, the JavaScript engine starts at the scope of the code that references the variable, moves to the top scope, and searches for the declared variable. Function-level Scope Most programming language like C, Java Block-level scope All code blocks (if, for, while, try / catch, etc.), not just the function body, create the local scope. Variables declared with the var keyword Function-level scope Accept only the code block of the function as the local scope. The let and const keywords introduced in ES6 support block level scopes. Lexical Scope Dynamic Scope The function’s top scope is determined by where the function is called. Lexical Scope / Static Scope The function’s top scope is determined by where the function is defined. Most programming languages follow the lexical scope. JavaScript follows a lexical scope. So it determines the top scope depending on where it is defined. Implicit Global VariableIf declare a variable without var keyword, it becomes a global variable. 123456789function foo() { i = 0; //implicit global variable}// var i = 0 is a duplicate declarationfor (var i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) { foo(); console.log(i);} // infinite loop Global variables are so dangerous!","link":"/2019/05/08/12-Scope/"},{"title":"13. Problems with Global Variables","text":"1. Life Cycle of a Variable변수는 선언에 의해 생성되고 할당을 통해 값을 가진다. 생성된 변수는 언젠가는 소멸한다. 변수가 생성되고 소멸되는 주기를 변수의 생명 주기라고 한다. 변수가 생성된다는 것은 메모리 공간을 차지하는 것이고, 소멸됨은 차지하던 메모리가 해제되는 것이다. 조금 더 정확히 말하면 변수가 소멸된다는 것은 등록된 식별자가 소멸한다는 것이다. 이때 식별자와 값의 바인딩이 해제된다. 어떤 지역 스코프가 사라질 때 그 스코프에 등록된 식별자들이 소멸된다. 함수 내부에서 선언된 지역 변수는 함수가 호출되면 생성되고 함수가 종료하면 소멸한다. 즉, 지역 변수의 생명주기는 함수와 생명 주기와 같다. 그래서 지역 변수의 생명주기는 비교적 짧다. 그러나 전역 변수는 다르다. 함수는 함수 몸체의 문이 끝나거나, return 문이 실행되면 종료한다. 하지만 전역 코드는 마지막 문이 끝나서 더 이상 실행할 문이 없어도 함수처럼 종료하지 않는다. 전역변수는 브라우저를 종료해서 애플리케이션을 종료할 때까지 유효하다. 즉, 전역 변수의 생명주기는 애플리케이션의 생명 주기와 일치한다. 이는 다음과 같은 문제점을 가진다. 2. Problem of Global Variable2.1. Implicit Coupling전역 변수는 코드의 전체 영역에서 사용할 수 있다. 이는 모든 코드에서 전역 변수를 참조하고 변경할 수 있는 암묵적 결합을 허용한다. 문제는 변수의 유효 범위가 크면 클수록 코드의 가독성이 나빠지고 의도치 않은 상태 변경이 일어난다는 것이다. 2.2. Long Life Cycle전역 변수는 생명 주기가 길다. 이는 다음과 같이 몇 가지 문제점을 가진다. 전역 변수의 상태를 변경할 수 있는 시간이 길다. 모든 함수가 참조할 수 있으므로 상태가 변경될 위험이 크다. 메모리 리소스를 오랜기간 차지한다. var 키워드는 변수의 중복 선언을 허용하므로 중간에 변수명이 중복되어 의도치 않은 재할당이 일어날 수 있다. 2.3. Exist at the End of the Scope Chain전역 변수의 또다른 문제점은 스코프 체인 가장 상위에 존재한다는 것이다. 이는 자바스크립트 엔진이 전역 변수를 찾을 때 가장 마지막 스코프까지 검색해야함을 의미한다. 즉, 전역 변수의 검색 속도가 가장 느리다. 2.4. Namespace Pollution자바스크립트의 특성으로, 분리되어있는 파일을 함께 import할 경우 하나의 전역 스코프를 공유한다. 따라서 다른 파일 내에서 동일한 이름으로 명명한 변수나 함수가 겹칠 경우 예상치 못한 결과를 가져올 수 있다. 3. How to Suppress Using Global Variables위에서 살펴본 바와 같이 전역 변수의 사용은 위험하다. 반드시 사용해야할 때가 아니라면 지역 변수를 사용해야 한다. 3.1. Immediately Invoke Function Expression즉시 실행 함수는 함수의 정의와 동시에 한 번만 호출되는 함수로, 모든 코드를 즉시 실행 함수로 감싸면 모든 변수는 즉시 실행 함수의 지역 변수가 된다. 함수는 스코프를 만들고, 함수 내에 선언된 변수는 지역 변수가 된다는 것을 이용한 방법이다. 123(function(){ var foo = 10; //local variable of IIF}()); 가장 간단하고 일반적인 방식이다. 3.2. Namespace Object전역 네임 스페이스 역할을 담당할 객체를 생성하고, 전역 변수처럼 사용하고 싶은 변수를 프로퍼티로 추가한다. 즉, 전역 변수를 네임 스페이스 객체의 프로퍼티로 등록하고 사용하는 방법이다. 12var GLOBAL = {}; // global namespace objectGLOBAL.name = 'Lee'; 현재는 잘 안 쓰는 방식. 3.3. Module Pattern모듈 패턴은 클래스를 모방하여 관련이 있는 변수와 함수를 모아서 즉시 실행함수로 감싸 하나의 모듈로 만든다. 모듈 패턴은 자바스크립트의 클로저를 기반으로 동작한다. 캡슐화란 보호하고자 하는 내부 구현을 외부로부터 감추는 것을 말한다. 캡슐화의 목적은 상태 유지로, 외부에서 객체 내부의 상태를 변경하는 것을 제한한다. C++이나 Java의 class는 기본적으로 Access modifier를 제공하여 공개 범위를 한정할 수 있게 한다. 자바스크립트는 Access modifier를 제공하지 않는다. 모듈 패턴은 전역 네임 스페이스의 오염을 막는 기능에 더해서, 한정적이기는 하지만 캡슐화를 구현하기 위해 사용한다. 1234567891011121314151617181920var Account = (function () { // private variable var balance = 0; return { deposit(money) { balance += money; return balance; }, withdraw(money) { balance -= money; return balance; } };}());console.log(Account.balance); // undefinedconsole.log(Account.deposit(3000)); //3000console.log(Account.withdraw(1000)); //2000 위 코드의 즉시 실행 함수는 외부에 노출할 메소드를 객체에 담아 반환한다. 이 때 반환되는 객체의 프로퍼티는 외부에 노출되는 퍼블릭 멤버이다. 반환되는 객체에 추가되지 않은 변수나 함수는 모두 외부에서 접근할 수 없는 프라이빗 멤버가 된다. Closure?그런데 즉시 실행 함수는 선언과 동시에 실행되고 종료되는데 deposit()과 withdraw() 메소드가 어떻게 num을 참조할 수 있을까? deposit()과 withdraw()는 즉시 실행 함수의 중첩 함수로, 중첩 함수가 외부 함수보다 더 오래 살아남아 있을 경우 이를 클로저라고 부른다. 자바스크립트의 함수 객체는 생성될 때, 프로퍼티 어트리뷰트로 [[Environment]]라는 내부 슬롯을 가진다. 이 곳에 자신이 생성될 때의 외부 스코프(Lexical scope)를 담는다. 이는 함수 객체가 소멸하기 전까지 유지된다. 위의 num같은 변수를 자유변수라고 한다. deposit()과 withdraw()는 같은 lexical scope object를 참조하고 있다. 모던 자바스크립트 프로그래밍에서는 클로저의 사용을 적극 권장한다. 3.4 ES6 Module import export ES6가 구체적인 구현 스펙을 제안하지 않아 대부분의 브라우저가 완전히 지원하지는 않는다. 그러나 Webpack 등의 모듈 번들러를 사용해서 ES6 모듈을 사용할 수 있다.","link":"/2019/05/09/13-Problems-with-global-variables/"},{"title":"16. Creating an Object with a Constructor Function","text":"객체 리터럴 표기법은 가장 일반적이고 간단한 객체 생성 방법이다. 객체는 객체 리터럴 표기법 외에도 다양한 방법으로 생성할 수 있다. 객체를 생성하기 위한 용도로 사용되는 함수를 생성자 함수라고 한다. 1. Object Constructor Function객체 리터럴 표기법은 분명 간단한 방법이지만, 같은 구조를 가진 객체를 여러 개 만들어야할 경우가 있다. new 연선자와 함께 Object 생성자 함수를 호출하면 빈 객체를 생성하여 반환한다. 생성한 빈 객체에 프로퍼티와 메소드를 추가한다. 123456const student = new Object();student.name = 'Park';student.sayHello = function () { console.log('Hi! I am ' + this.name);} Object 생성자 함수는 함수 객체이므로 프로퍼티와 메소드를 갖는다. 앞서 살펴본 Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor() 또한 Object 생성자 함수의 메소드이다. Constructor 함수는 new 연산자와 함께 호출해서 Object(instance)를 생성하는 함수이다. 생성자 함수에 의해 생성된 객체는 instance라고 한다. Instance생성자 함수도 객체이므로 생성자 함수나 클래스가 생성한 객체를 다른 객체와 구분하기 위해 실체라는 의미로 인스턴스라고 한다. 1.1. Built-in Constructor Function (Wrapper Object)자바스크립트는 Object 생성자 함수 이외에도 String, Number, Boolean, Function, Array, Date, RegExp 등의 built-in(intrinsic) 생성자 함수를 제공한다. 이들은 전역객체(window)의 메소드이다. 자바스크립트에서 함수는 객체이므로 Built-in 생성자 함수는 객체로서 메소드도 가진다. 123const obj = new Object('str'); //가능하지만 잘 안 씀const strObj = new String('str');const numObj = new Number(123); String, Number 생성자 함수로 형변환도 가능하지만 잘 안 쓴다. Wrapper Object원시 값을 객체처럼 쓰면 자바스크립트 엔진이 원시값 타입의 객체로 순간 바꾸고 평가한 후 다시 원시 값으로 되돌린다. 이 때 원시값 타입의 객체를 wrapper object라고 부른다. 2. Constructor Function객체 리터럴로 객체를 생성하는 경우 프로퍼티 구조가 동일해도 매번 같은 프로퍼티와 메소드를 작성해야하는 문제가 있다. 객체 리터럴은 한 번 평가되어 값을 만드므로 재사용할 수 없으며 동일한 코드의 중복 또한 문제가 된다. 2.1 Advantages of object creation by constructor function생성자 함수로 객체를 생성하면 프로퍼티 구조가 동일한 객체 여러 개를 간편하게 생성할 수 있다. 생성자 함수는 일반 함수와 동일한 방법으로 미리 정의한 후에, new 연산자와 함께 호출했을 때만 생성자 함수로 동작한다. 생성자 함수는 보통 Pascal case로 naming 한다. (ex. Object, Circle, String 등) 123456789101112// Constructor Functionfunction Circle(radius) { // this indicates the instance that the constructor function will create. this.radius = radius; this.getDiameter = function () { return 2 * this.radius; };}// instance creationconst circle1 = new Circle(5);const circle2 = new Circle(10); new 연산자 없이 함수를 호출하면, 일반 함수로 호출되는 것이므로 this는 전역 객체(window)가 된다. thisthis는 객체 자신의 프로퍼티나 메소드를 참조하기 위한 Self-regerencing variable이다. this가 가리키는 객체는 함수 호출 방식에 따라 동적으로 결정된다. Function call Object this points to As a normal function Global object (window) As a method Object that called a method As a constructor function Instance that a constructor function will create in the future. 12345678910111213function foo () { console.log(this);}// Called as a general functionfoo (); // window// Called as a methodconst obj = { foo }; // ES6 property shorthandobj.foo(); // obj// Called as a constructor functionconst inst = new foo(); // inst 2.3. Internal method [[Call]] and [[Constructor]]함수 객체는 일반 객체와 달리 내부 메소드로 [[Call]]과 [[Constructor]]를 가진다. 내부 메소드 [[Call]]은 함수가 일반 함수로 호출되었을 때 실행되고, 내부 메소드 [[Constructor]]는 함수가 생성자 함수로 호출되었을 때 실행된다. 내부 메소드 [[Call]]이 구현되어 있는 객체를 callable, [[Constuctor]]가 구현되어 있는 객체는 constructor, [[Constructor]]가 구현되어 있지 않은 객체는 non-constructor라고 부른다. 단, arrow function은 constructor function으로 생성할 수 없다. ES6의 메소드 축약 표현으로 선언한 메소드 또한 non-constructor이다. 따라서 모든 함수는 callable이지만 모두 constructor인 것은 아니다. 2.4. constructors and non-constructors자바스크립트 엔진은 함수 생성시 FunctionCreate라는 abstract operation을 사용한다. Abstract operation FunctionCreate는 함수 정의가 평가될 때 호출된다. 함수 정의 방식에 따라서 FunctionCreate의 kind parameter에 함수의 종류를 나타내는 문자열이 전달된다. Kinds Strings 일반 함수 정의(함수 선언문, 함수 표현식) 평가 Normal 화살표 함수 정의 평가 Arrow 메소드 정의 평가 Method 일반 함수로 정의된 함수만 constructor, Arrow나 Method는 con-constructor이다. 이 때 주의해야할 점은 ES6의 메소드 축약 표현만을 메소드 정의로 인정한다는 것이다. 2.5. How the Constructor Function Works생성자 함수의 역할은 인스턴스를 생성하는 것과 생성된 인스턴스의 프로퍼티 값을 초기화하는 것이다. 생성자 함수가 호출되면, 자바스크립트 내부에서 빈 객체를 만들고 this에 할당한다. (this binding) 내부 코드를 실행한 후 this를 return한다. 즉, this는 생성자 함수로 생성하는 instance가 된다. 12345678910function Person(name) { // 1. create empty object and bind it to this. this = {} // 2. run internal codes (create property) this.name = name; // 3. return this}console.log(new Person('Park')); // Person {name: 'Park'} 2.6. new Operatornew 연산자와 함께 constructor인 함수를 호출하면 함수는 생성자 함수로 동작한다. 이 때 함수 객체의 내부 메소드 [[Constructor]]가 호출된다. 함수 내부의 this는 생성자 함수가 생성할 instance를 가리킨다. new 연산자 없이 함수를 호출하면 함수 객체의 내부 메소드 [[Call]]이 호출된다. 이 때 함수 내부의 this는 전역 객체 window를 가리킨다. 2.7. new.targetnew 연산자 없이 생성자 함수를 호출하는 것을 방지하기 위해서 ES6에서 new.target을 지원한다. new.target은 함수 내부에서 지역 변수와 같이 사용되는 meta property이다. (IE는 new.target을 지원하지 않음!) 함수가 new 연산자와 함께 호출되면 new.target은 함수 자신을 가리키고, new 연산자 없이 호출된 함수 내부의 new.target은 undefined이다. new 연산자와 함께 호출된 생성자 함수로부터 생성된 instance는 프로토타입에 의해 생성자 함수와 연결된다.","link":"/2019/05/10/16-Creating-an-Object-with-a-Constructor-Function/"},{"title":"14. let, const and a Block-level Scope","text":"1. Problems with Variables declared with the var keywordES5까지 변수를 선언할 수 있는 유일한 키워드는 var 하나였다. var 키워드로 선언된 변수는 다른 언어와는 구별되는 특징을 가진다. 1.1.

Variable Hoistinglet 키워드로 선언한 변수는 변수 호이스팅이 발생하지 않는 것처럼 동작한다. 12console.log(foo); // ReferenceError: foo is not definedlet foo; 그렇다면 let 키워드로 선언한 선언문은는 런타임 이전에 실행되지 않는 것일까? 일반적으로 var 키워드로 선언한 변수는 런타임 이전에 자바스크립트 엔진에 의해 암묵적으로 declaration phase와 initialization phase가 한 번에 진행된다. Declaration phase : Execution context의 lexical environment에 있는 스코프에 변수 식별자를 등록하여 변수의 존재를 알린다. Initialization phase : declaration phase가 끝나는 즉시 값을 저장하기 위한 메모리 공간을 확보하고 암묵적으로 undefined로 변수를 할당해 초기화한다. let 키워드로 선언한 변수는 “Declaration phase”와 “Initialization Phase”가 분리되어 진행된다. 즉, 런타임 이전에 암묵적으로 declaration phase가 먼저 실행되지만 initialization phase는 런타임에 변수 선언문에 도달했을 때 실행된다. initialization phase가 실행되기 이전에 변수에 접근하려고 하면 reference error가 발생한다. 아직 변수를 위한 메모리 공간이 확보되지 않았기 때문이다. 따라서 스코프의 시작 지점부터 변수 선언문을 만나서 initialization phase가 시작되기 전까지는 변수를 참조할 수 없다. TDZ (Temporal Dead Zone)스코프의 시작 지점부터 Initialization phase 시작 지점까지의 구간 let 키워드로 선언한 변수는 hoisting이 되지 않는 게 아니라, 선언문을 만났을 때 initialization phase를 진행하는 것이다. 2.4. Global Object and let전역 객체(Global Object)는 모든 객체의 유일한 최상위 객체를 의미하며 일반적으로 브라우저 환경에서는 window 객체, Node.js 환경에서는 global 객체를 말한다. var 키워드로 선언한 전역 변수와, 키워드 없이 선언하고 값을 할당한 암묵적 전역변수, 그리고 전역 함수는 전역 객체의 프로퍼티가 된다. 1234567var x = 1;y = 2;function foo() {}console.log(window.x === x); // trueconsole.log(window.y === y); // trueconsole.log(window.foo === foo); // true 전역 객체의 프로퍼티는 전역 변수처럼 사용할 수 있다. 전역 객체의 프로퍼티를 참조할 때 window를 생략할 수 있다. 그러나 let 키워드로 선언한 전역 변수는 전역 객체 window의 프로퍼티가 아니다. let 전역 변수는 전역 렉시컬 환경의 선언적 환경 레코드 내에 존재하게 된다. 123let x = 1;console.log(window.x); // undefined 3. const Keywordconst 키워드는 상수(변하지 않는 고정된 값)를 선언하기 위해 사용한다. let 과 const 는 동일한 특징이 많다. 차이점을 살펴보자. 3.1. Declaration and Initializationlet 키워드로 선언한 변수와 달리 const 키워드로 선언한 변수는 재할당이 금지된다. 123const PI = 3.14;PI = 3.141492; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable. const 키워드로 선언한 변수는 반드시 선언과 할당이 동시에 이루어져야 한다. 이후로는 재할당을 할 수 없다. const 키워드로 선언한 변수 또한 block-level scope를 갖는다. 3.2. Constant변수를 만들고 재할당을 하지 않을 거라면 상수를 적극적으로 쓰는 게 좋다. 고정된 값을 상수로 만들어 쓰면 코드의 가독성을 높일 수 있다. 상수는 프로그램 전체에서 사용하므로, 유지보수에 효율적이다. 3.3. const Keyword and Objectconst 키워드로 선언한 변수에 primitive value를 할당한 경우, primitive value는 immutable value이고 재할당이 금지되므로 할당된 값을 변경할 수 있는 방법이 없다. const 키워드로 선언한 변수에 객체를 할당한 경우, 재할당이 금지되는 것은 마찬가지이다. 그러나 객체는 mutable value이므로 const 키워드로 선언된 변수에 할당된 객체는 변경이 가능하다. 즉, const 키워드는 재할당을 금지할 뿐 immutable을 의미하지 않는다. immutable과 mutable은 상수와 변수의 개념이 아닌, 값의 변경에 대한 개념이다. 4. var vs. let vs. const변수 선언에는 기본적으로 const를 사용하고 let은 재할당이 필요한 경우에 사용하는 것이 좋다. ES6 사용시 var 키워드 사용하지 않는다. 재할당이 필요한 경우에만 let 키워드를 사용하고, 변수의 스코프를 최소화 한다. 객체와 변경을 하지 않을 원시 값에는 const 키워드를 사용한다. var 와 let/const를 함께 쓰지 않는다.","link":"/2019/05/09/14-let-const-and-a-Block-level-Scope/"},{"title":"19.

(C처럼) Hoisting: hoisting은 끌어올린다는 뜻이다. 자바스크립트에서는 변수가 끌어올려진다. 이 때, 변수의 선언은 hoist되지만 할당부(값)는 hoist되지 않는다. 즉 함수의 선언은 hoist되지만 변수의 값으로 선언한 함수는 hoist되지 않는다. 그래서 for문에서 var i =0으로 선언한 후 함수 종료 후에 i를 부르면 정의되지 않았다고 뜬다. 그러나 var i가 아니라 그냥 i=0 로 선언하면 i가 hoisting되어 global variable이 된다. 느낀 점scope와 hoisting 등 javaScript를 공부하니 그동안 아무 것도 모르는 상태에서 이것저것 만들어 보면서, 이해되지 않던 오류들이 조금씩 이해되기 시작했다. 어쩌다보니 LeetCode 알고리즘을 스터디로 함께 풀게 됐다. 어려명과 함께 공부하는 건 처음이지만 배울 점이 많을 거라고 생각한다. indexOf() 등 여러 javaScript String 관련 method를 접할 때마다 정리하고 활용할 수 있도록 해야겠다.","link":"/2019/03/24/190322-24-TIL/"},{"title":"190326-TIL","text":"Today I Learned 프로젝트 진행 중! 무식하면 몸이 고생한다를 뼈저리게 느끼고 있다. 백엔드가 없고 DB를 관리할 수가 없어서 리소스와 데이터를 수동으로 정리해 폴더에 넣는 작업을 했다.

Creation of JavaScriptIn 1995, the Netscape Communications decided to introduce a lightweight programming language to dynamically express static HTML. So JavaScript developed by Brendan Eich. JavaScript was mounted on Netscape Navigator 2 which is web browser of Netscape Communications, named “Mocha” in March, 1996. In September, renamed to “LiveScript” and finally named as “JavaScript” in December. So JavaScript is now the standard programming language for all browsers. But JavaScript has not grown smoothly 2. Fragmentation and Standardization of JavaScriptIn August 1996, Microsoft added a derived version of JavaScript, “JScript”, to Internet Explorer 3.0. But the problem is that JScript and JavaScript are not standardized and are moderately compatible. In other words, they have competitively begun adding features that only work with their browsers to gain market share in their browsers. This has led to cross-browsing issues where webpages are not working properly, and it has become extremely difficult to develop webpages that work across all browsers. Thus, the need for stadard of JavaScript which works same in all browser has begun to be raised. For this, Netscape Communications requested standardization of JavaScript to ECMA International in November 1996. Version Release Specification ES1 1997 First version ES2 1998 Application of the same standards as ISO/IEC 16262 international standards ES3 1999 Regular Expression, try … catch Exception ES5 2009 Standard released with HTML5.

History of JavaScriptEarly JavaScript was used for limited purposes to perform the supplementary functions of webpages. During this time, most logics were run primarily on Web servers and browsers were simply rendering HTML and CSS delivered from the server. Rendering?Rendering refers to interpreting data expressed in HTML and CSS and expressing it visually on a browser. In 1999, Ajax(Asynchronous JavaScript and XML), a communication function that allows server and browser to exchange data asynchronously using JavaScript, has emerger under the name of XMLHttpRequest. Previous webpages worked by receiving complete HTML from the server and rendering the entire web page. So when screen switches, it received a new HTML file from server and started rendering a whole web page again from beginning. This is a disadvantageous way because unnecessary data communication occurs when receive HTML including unchanged parts from a server and browser should be rendering that whole HTML again including unchanged parts. This causes the screen to flash momentarily when a screen transition occurs, which has been accepted as the limit for web applications. The advent of Ajax changed the previous paradigm. In other words, it make possible to do not rendering again the parts unnecessary to change and rendering only the part need to change by receiving only a necessary data from server. This enables fast performance and smooth screen transitions similar to desktop applications in web browsers. In 2005, Google Maps, which operates on JavaScript and Ajax in a web browser, has shown performance and smooth screen transitions that are comparable to desktop applications. In 2006, the advent of jQuery made it easier to control the rather cumbersome DOM(Document Object Model) and resolved cross-browsing issues to some extent. jQuery quickly secured a large user base. This resulted in the mass production of developers who preferred jQuery, which was easier to learn and more intuitive than JavaScript. In 2008, V8 JavaScript Engine from google made more fast performance in web browser. With the advent of the V8 JavaScript engine, JavaScript has become a web application development programming language that can provide a user experience(UX) similar to that of desktop applications. In 2009, the Node.js that enable operate JavaScript in an environment other than a browser emerged. JavaScript is now a standard for web programming languages that cover not only front-end but also back-end areas. 4. JavaScript and ECMAScriptECMAScriptECMAScript refers ECMA-262, which standard specification of JavaScript and defines core syntax such as the type, value, objace and property, function, built-in object, etc. Each JavaScriptJavaScript is typically a programming language that encompasses ECMAScript as a core and client side Web API, which is supported separately by the browser. Web APIDOM, BOM, Canvas, XMLHttpRequest, Fetch, requestAnimationFrame, SVG, Web Storage, Web Component, Web worker, etc. Apart from ECMAScript, the client side Web API is managed as a separate specification by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). 5. Characteristics of JavaScriptJavaScript is one of the components that compose the web with HTML and CSS, and is the only programming language that works with a web browser. It use basic syntax from C, prototype-based inheritance from Self, first-class function from Scheme. JavaScript is interpreter language that developer not have to do compile work. Almost modern JavaScript engines(V8 by Chrome, Spidermonkey by FireFox, JavaScriptCore by Safari, Chakra by Microsoft Edge) combined advantage of interpreter and compiler to resole disadvantage of slow interpreter. Actually JavaScript complie but not make executable file. So JavaScript is interpreter lanuage. JavaScript is a multi-paradigm programming language that supports imprerative, functional, and prototype-based object-oriented programming.

JavaScript Develop Environment and Execute","text":"Before this chapter, What is Web API?While the most common scripting language ECMAscript (more widely known as JavaScript) is developed by Ecma, a great many of the APIs made available in browsers have been defined at W3C. What is scripting?A script is program code that doesn’t need pre-processing(e.g. compiling) before being run. In the context of Web browser, scripting usually refers to program code written in JavaScript that is executed by browser when a page is downloaded, or in response to an event triggered by the user. Scripting can make Web pages more dynamic.For Example, without reloading a new version of a page it may allow modifications to the content of that page : DHTML(Dynamic HTML) allow content to be added to or sent from that page : AJAX(Asyncronous JavaScript and XML) What scripting interfaces are available ?The most basic scripting interface developed by W3C is the DOM, the Document Object Model which allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure and stype of documents. DOM specifications form the core of DHTML. Modifications of the content using the DOM by the user and by scripts trigger events that developers can make use of to build rich user interface. A number of more advanced interfaces are being standardized, for instance: XMLHttpRequest makes it possible to load additional content from the Web without loading a new document, a core component of AJAX, the Geolocation API makes the user’s current location available to browser-based applications, several APIs make the integration of Web applications with the local file system and storage seamless. Execution Environment of JavaScriptAll browsers have JavaScript engine that can inpterpreter and execute JavaScript. Not only browser but also Node.js has JavaScript engine. So JavaScript can operate in both browser and Node.js environment. Basically code that operate in browser also operate in Node.js environment too. But the browser and Node.js have different purpose. The main purpose of browser is execute HTML, CSS, JavaScript to rendering web page on screen, but the other one is provide server development envorinment. So both of browser and Node.js can operate ECMAScript(core of JavaScript) but additional features provided by Node.js and browser and ECMAScript are incompatible. Node.js environment ES + Node.js API (file control) Browser Rendering HTML, CSS JavaScript : ES + Web API (created by browser vendors and managed by W3C) (DOM API, event) only browser can execute As such, the browser supports ECMAScript and client side Web APIs such as DOM, BOM, Canvas, XMLHttpRequest, Fetch, requestAnimationFrame, SVG, Web Storage, Web Component, and Web worker. Node.js does not support client side Web APIs and supports ECMAScript and Node.js-specific APIs. Web BrowserHow does a Web Browser work?Most programming languages run on Operating System, but JavaScript in Web application runs with HTML and CSS in a browser. So efficient JavaScript programming is available when considering Web browser environment. Core function of Web browser is that request the Web page user want and represent the response from server in browser. Web browser receives HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and image files from the server. HTML and CSS files are parsed by the rendering enginde’s HTML parser and CSS parser, converted into DOM tree and CSSOM tree, and combined into a Render Tree. Browser represent Web pages by this Render tree. JavaScript is processed by JavaScript engine, not the Rendering engine. HTML parser stops DOM construction process when meet the script tag, and passes control to the JavaScript engine to execute JavaScript code. Control passed JavaScript engine loads, parses and executes the JavaScript code in script tag or JavaScript file defined in script tag’s src attribute. Interpreter that used in most modern Web browser doesn’t compile like typical compiler language but compiles and executes a part of source code in complex way. Interperter Translates program one statement at a time. It takes less amount of time to analyze the source code but the overall execution time is slower. No intermediate object code is generated, hence are memory efficient. Continues translating the program until the first error is met, in which case it stops. Hence debugging is easy. Programming language like Python, Ruby use interpreters. Compiler Scans the entire program and translates it as a whole into machine code. It takes large amount of time to analyze the source code but the overall execution time is comparatively faster. It takes large amount of time to analyze the source code but the overall execution time is comparatively faster. It generates the error message only after scanning the whole program. Hence debugging is comparatively hard. Programming language like C, C++ use compilers. Source code is composed of simple strings. So interpret string codes to make the AST(Abstrack Syntax Tree) that has syntax and semantics. TokenizingSeparate the source code into tokens, the smallest unit of meaning, by lexical analysis. ParsingSyntactically analysis the set of tokens to create AST. Execute codeCreated AST is converted to byte code or optimized machine code and run by interpreter. If execution of JavaScript is finished, pass control to HTML parser and resume DOM creation from the time when browser stopped. As such, browsers process HTML, CSS, and JavaScript synchronously. This means creation of DOM can be delayed by blocking from script tag. So the position of script tag has important meaning. You should put script code at bottom of HTML file. It prevent error that can be occured when JavaScript touch DOM before DOM creation completed. Node.jsA client side, or simple web application that works on a web browser, can be developed with just a browser. However, as the project grows in size, it is necessary to introduce external libraries such as React and jQuery, or to use several tools such as Babel, Webpack, ESLint, etc. Node.js and npm are required. Node.js and npmNode.js, announced by Ryan Dahl in 2009 is a JavaScript runtime environment built with Chrome V8 JavaScript engine. Simply, Node.js is JavaScript execution environment that enable JavaScript to run in addition to browser. npm(node package manager) is JavaScript package manager. Itself a repository include packaged modules available in Node.js and provide CLI to install and management.

Abstraction추상화는 encapsulation을 자연스럽게 확장한 것으로 볼 수 있다.추상화를 적용한다는 것은, 각 object를 사용할 때 오직 high-level machanism만을 공개해야한다는 것이다. 이 mechanism은 내부 implementation을 숨기고, 오직 관련된 객체의 operation으로만 접근할 수 있다. 즉, 사용자는 class의 method가 어떻게 작동하는지 알 필요 없이 제공된 interface(method name, parameter, return value)만 알고 사용할 수 있다.

Variable","text":"What is variable?Application uses data. And the variable is core concept for managing data. Computer is computing machine. To do simple operation like sum of 1 and 2, computer should memorize these operand 1 and 2 in register. Computer uses memory to memorze the data. MemoryMemory is a collection of memory cells that can store data. Size of one cell is 1byte(8bit) and computer read or wirte data by one cell, 1 byte size. Each memory cell has its own address. That address means location of memory space and can be represented from 0 to memory size. Computer can simply compute 1 + 2, but how to use this result of sum? What you need at this point is the variable. To store data in memory and read to use data from memory, programming language provide variable. Variable refers name of memory space or memory space itself. Simply, variable is mechanism that store and refer data values. Through variable, developer can store, refer and change value wihout access to memory directly. Just, like it. 1var result = 1 + 2; In JavaScript, var means variable. In that code, ‘result’ is a name of the variable and 3 is a value of the variable. Storing value in variable is called assignment and reading data from variable is called reference. The variable name is the name given to the memory space where the value is stored for the person. Declaration of variableVariable name is the name given to memory space. To use a variable, variable must be declared. Use var, let, const keywords to declare variable. Before ES6 introduced let and const keywords, var was the only method to declare variable. KeywordKeyword is kind of command that defines the actions performed by JavaScript engines that execute JavaScript code. When JavaScript engine meets 1var soup; After declaring a variable, the variable never been assigned. Therefore, the memory space allocated by the variable declaration may be considered to be empty, but the allocated memory space is implicitly allocated with the value undefined by the JavaScript engine. This is a unique feature of JavaScript. undefinedundefined is primitive value of JavaScript. JavaScript engine operates declaration of variable by 2 phases. Declaration phase : Register the variable name to tell the JavaScript engine the existence of the variable. Initialization phase : Allocates memory space to store the value and implicitly assigns undefined. Variable declaration using the var keyword proceeds both in the declaration phase and in the initialization phase. var soup; registers the variable name soup through the declaration phase, and initializes it by assigning undefined to the variable score through the initialization step. In general, initialization refers to assigning a value first after a variable is declared. JavaScript automatically do implicit initialization to undefined. Therefore, even if you declare a variable and do not assign any value, the variable has a value of undefined. If you do not go through the initialization phase, the reserved memory space may still contain values that were previously used by other applications. These values are called garbage values. Therefore, garbage value can be obtained by referring to a variable value immediately after allocating memory space and not allocating a value. Declarations are required to use variables. Not just variables, but all identifiers (functions, classes, etc.). If you access the identifier without declaration, a ReferenceError is raised. ReferenceError is a error that occurs when the JavaScript engine tries to reference a value through an identifier but can not find the registered identifier. Variable Declaration run time and Hoisting123console.log(soup);var soup; In C, the avobe code will occur compile error because it access to the variable before its declaration. But in JavaScript print undefined instead of ReferenceError. Variable declaration is processed before the run-time that source code execute in line step. In other words, JavaScript engine estimate entire source code in advance. At this time, it finds all of declaration(variable declaration, function declaration), declare and initialize identifiers. After that run source codes sequentially except declarations. What is Hoisting?Hoist means to lift something. It is a variable that is hoisted in JavaScript. Hoist means that the definition of a variable is separated into declarations and allocations according to its scope.Declarations execute before other codes so it seems like declarations are hoisted to top of the source code. In JavaScript, all of variable declarations are hoisted. Warning Function hoisting hoists function declarations too, but not hoist the value of variables. So think separate declarations and assignment is important. It’s relevant with run-time and parsing-time. 1234567891011foo();function foo(){ console.log('ok');};// Okfoo();var foo = function foo(){ console.log('ok');};// Syntax error! Assignment of Values1234var soup; // Variable Declarationsoup = 3; // Assignment valuevar soup = 3; // Variable declaration and assigment Variable declaration is executed at parsing-time and assignment is executed in run-time, affter the parsing-time. Of course when declare variable, it is initialized to undefined. 12345console.log(soup); // undefinedvar soup = 3; // Variable declaration and assigmentconsole.log(soup); // 3 So soup is re-initialized to 3. Reassignment of Value12var soup = 3; // Declaration and Assignmentsoup = 5; // Reassignment Variable that declared by var keyword can be reassigned. Reassignment is that variable discards the current value and store new value. Reassignment changes old value to new value. If the reassignment is not possible, it is called a constant not a variable. A constant is a value that does not change once set. In other words, constants are variables that can be assigned only once. const keywordIntroduced from ES6, variable that declared by const is prohibited reassignment. But const keyword does not only used for constant. Identifier Naming ConventionAn identifier is a unique name that can identify any data. The identifier shall conform to the following naming conventions. Identifiers can include letters, numbers, underscore ( _ ), and dollar sign ($), except for special characters. However, identifiers must begin with a letter, underscore ( _ ), or dollar sign ($), except for special characters. It is not allowed to start with a number. Reserved words can not be used as identifiers. Since the variable name is an identifier, the above naming rules must be followed. There are 4 naming conventions that are often used to distinguish words at a time when naming identifiers composed of one or more English words. 123456789101112// camelCasevar firstName;// snake_casevar first_name;// PascalCasevar FirstName;// typeHungarianCasevar strFirstName; // type + identifiervar $elem = $('.myClass'); // jQuery Any naming convention may be used if it is consistent. The most common is to use a camel case for the name of a variable or function and a Pascal case for the name of a constructor function or class. In order to improve the readability of the entire code, it is advantageous to follow the above naming convention. Reference Data type &amp; Variable","link":"/2019/04/30/4-Variable/"},{"title":"8.

Call by Assignment (Call by Object Reference) The actual parameters (arguments) to a function call are introduced in the local symbol table of the called function when it is called; thus, arguments are passed using call by value (where the value is always an object reference, not the value of the object). [1] When a function calls another function, a new local symbol table is created for that call. 이 문장이 나를 얼마나 헷갈리게 했는지 모른다. 그러니까 Python에서는 function의 argument가 call by value로 넘어오는데, 그 value는 언제나 object의 값이 아닌 object의 reference라는 것이다. Actually, call by object reference would be a better description, since if a mutable object is passed, the caller will see any changes the callee makes to it (items inserted into a list). 정확하게는 call by object reference라는 설명이 더 맞다. 왜냐면 mutable 객체가 넘어올 때에는 call by reference처럼 원본 값을 변경할 수 있기 때문이다. 파이썬은 모든 것이 object이고, Object에는 두 종류가 있다. Immutable object int, float, str, tuple Immtable 객체가 함수의 인자로 전달되면, 처음에는 call by reference로 받지만 값이 변경되면 call by value로 동작한다. 즉, 함수 내에서 formal parameter 값이 바뀌어도 actual parameter에는 영향이 없다. 함수 내부에서 값을 변경할 수 없다! 그래서 tuple은 변경하려면 함수에서 element와 tuple 인자로 넘겨 아예 새로 할당해줘야 함 Mutable object list, dict, set Mutable 객체가 함수의 인자로 넘어가면 call by reference도 동작한다. 즉, object referene가 전달되어 actual parameter의 값에 영향을 미칠 수도 있다. 새로운 객체를 할당하는 게 아니라면, 함수 내부에서 값을 변경할 수 있다! 정리 Python은 함수를 실행할때 Call by reference같은 느낌으로 reference를 넘겨준다. 하지만 이때 넘겨주는 것은 변수(Variable)의 reference가 아니라 변수가 담고 있는 자료(Data)의 reference이다. 자료가 mutable하다면 변경해도 reference가 보존되므로 결과적으로 Call by reference처럼 보일 것이고, 자료가 immutable하다면 결과적으로 Call by value처럼 보일 것이다.","link":"/2019/04/22/Call-by-Value-Call-by-Reference-and-Call-by-Object-Reference/"},{"title":"9. Object Literal","text":"What is Object?JavaScript is an object-based programming language and almost “everything” that makes up JavaScript is an object. The rest of the values (functions, arrays, regular expressions, etc.) are all objects except primitive types. Object / reference type is a complex data structure that consists of several types of values (primitive type values or other objects) in a single unit. Primitive value Object immutable value mutable value pass by value pass by reference Object is a set of properties that consist of keys and values. Any value that is available in JavaScript can be used as the value of the property. Functions in JavaScript are first-class objects, so they can be treated as values. JavaScript functions are first-class objects, so they can be used as property values. If the property value is a function, it is called a method to distinguish it from a normal function. Attributes are refer to additional information of an object. Properties are describing the characteristics of an object. An object is a set of methods, which means properties that refer to data and behavior that can refer to and manipulate data. Create Object by Object LiteralClass-based object-oriented languages such as C ++ and Java pre-define classes and create objects by calling the constructor with the new operator at the point in time. However, JavaScript is a prototype-based object-oriented language that creates objects differently. Then how JavaScript creates object? Object literal Object constructor function Constructor function Object.create method Class (ES6) The most basic and general method is using object literal. 12345678910// empty objectvar empty = {};// At the time of assignment, the object literal is interpreted and the resulting object is created.var student = { name: 'Park', hello: function () { Console.log('Hello. I'm ${this.name}.'); }}; The {} used to create the object is not a block of code. It is an object literal because it ends with a ;. You can create a property as soon as you create the object by including the property in an object literal, or you can dynamically add a property after you create the object. PropertyAn object is a set of properties. A property consists of a key and a value. The values that can be used for property key and property values are as follows. Property key : all strings include empty string or symbol value Property value : all values in JavaScript Quotes can be omitted if the property key is a name that conforms to the identifier naming convention, that is, a valid name that can be used in JavaScript. 12345678var student = { name: 'Park'};// Dynamically add property keystudent['age'] = 25;console.log(student); // {name: \"Park\", age: 25} Property keys are allowed to be duplicated, and in the event of duplication, the last declared key is valid. MethodIf the property value is a function, it is called a method to distinguish it from a normal function. In other words, a method means a function restricted to an object. 12345678var circle = { radius: 5, // ← property getDiameter: function () { // ← method return 2 * this.radius; // this pointing circle }};console.log(circle.getDiameter()); // 10 this is a reference variable that points to the object that called it. Access of PropertyYou can access the properties in such a way, Dot notation Bracket notation 123456var student = { name: 'Park'};console.log(student.name); // Access by dot notaionconsole.log(student['name']; // Access by bracket notation If the property key follows the identifier naming convention, 2 notations are both available. If not, only bracket notation is available. If the property key is not a name that does conform to the identifier naming convention, that is, not a valid name that can be used in JavaScript, must use square bracket notation. However, the quotation marks '' can be omitted if the property key is a string of numbers. Update Property ValueIf assign a value to an existing property, the property value is updated. 1234567var student = { name: 'Park'};student.name = 'Kim';console.log(student); // {name: \"Kim\"} Dynamic property creation1234567var student = { name: 'Park'};student.age = '22';console.log(student); // {name: \"Park\", age: \"22\"} Can add, modify, and delete properties after object creation is complete.

Decode the Morse code","text":"CodeWars 6kyu. Decode the Morse codeDecode Morse code to plain text The Morse code encodes every character as a sequence of “dots” and “dashes”. For example, the letter A is coded as ·−, letter Q is coded as −−·−, and digit 1 is coded as ·−−−−. The Morse code is case-insensitive, traditionally capital letters are used. When the message is written in Morse code, a single space is used to separate the character codes and 3 spaces are used to separate words. For example, the message HEY JUDE in Morse code is ···· · −·−− ·−−− ··− −·· ·. NOTE: Extra spaces before or after the code have no meaning and should be ignored. In addition to letters, digits and some punctuation, there are some special service codes, the most notorious of those is the international distress signal SOS (that was first issued by Titanic), that is coded as ···−−−···.

Dubstep덥스텝 제목을 Decoding 하기 Polycarpus works as a DJ in the best Berland nightclub, and he often uses dubstep music in his performance. Recently, he has decided to take a couple of old songs and make dubstep remixes from them. Let’s assume that a song consists of some number of words (that don’t contain WUB). To make the dubstep remix of this song, Polycarpus inserts a certain number of words “WUB” before the first word of the song (the number may be zero), after the last word (the number may be zero), and between words (at least one between any pair of neighbouring words), and then the boy glues together all the words, including “WUB”, in one string and plays the song at the club. For example, a song with words “I AM X” can transform into a dubstep remix as “WUBWUBIWUBAMWUBWUBX” and cannot transform into “WUBWUBIAMWUBX”. Recently, Jonny has heard Polycarpus’s new dubstep track, but since he isn’t into modern music, he decided to find out what was the initial song that Polycarpus remixed.

Operator를 통해서만 member에 접근할 수 있다. Class와 Instance, object의 차이 클래스(class)란 똑같은 무엇인가를 계속해서 만들어낼 수 있는 설계 도면 같은 것이고(과자 틀), 객체(object)란 클래스에 의해서 만들어진 피조물(과자틀에 의해서 만들어진 과자)을 뜻한다. class에 의해서 만들어진 Object를 instance라고도 한다. 그렇다면 Object와 Instance의 차이는 무엇일까?이렇게 생각해 보자. a = Cookie() 이렇게 만들어진 a는 Object이다. 그리고 a라는 Object는 Cookie의 Instance이다. 즉, Instance라는 말은 특정 Object(a)가 어떤 Class(Cookie)의 객체인지를 관계 위주로 설명할 때 사용된다. 즉, “a는 instance” 보다는 “a는 object”라는 표현이 어울리며, “a는 Cookie의 object” 보다는 “a는 Cookie의 instance”라는 표현이 훨씬 잘 어울린다. Public, Private and Protected | Python Access ModifierC++, Java와 같이 클래식한 object-oriented 언어에서는 public, private, protected와 같은 키워드로 class의 member에 대한 접근을 제어한다. Class의 Private member는 class 외부에서 접근이 불가능하며 class 내부에서만 접근될 수 있다. Class 내의 Public member는 class 외부에서도 접근할 수 있다. 같은 class의 object는 public method를 호출하도록 요구된다. Private instance variable과 public method를 함께 써야지만 데이터 encapsulation의 원칙에 따르는 것이다. Class의 protected member는 오직 해당 class와 그 class를 상속받은 child class만이 접근할 수 있다. 이는 parent class가 child class에게 특정한 리소스를 상속할 수 있게 한다. 그런데 Python은 instance variable과 method에 대해서 접근 제한을 하는 방식이 따로 없다. Python vaiable이나 method의 이름 앞에 한개 또는 2개의 _(underscore)를 붙여서 protected와 private으로 구분하기로 약속한다.

Function LiteralJust as objects are created as object literals, functions can also be created as function literals. Function literal consists of function keyword, function name, list of parameters and function body. A function literal is evaluated to create a function object. Function name Since the function name is an identifier, it must conform to the identifier naming rules. A function name is an identifier that can be referenced only within a function body. The function name can be omitted. A function with a function name is called a named function, and a function without a function name is called an anonymous function. List of parameters Wrap 0 or more parameters in parentheses and separate them with commas. Parameters are assigned arguments. Parameters are treated the same as variables in the function body. Function body It is a block of code that defines the statements to be executed in batches as a unit of execution when the function is called. The function body is executed by a function call. A function literal is evaluated to produce a value, which is an object. In other words, the function of JavaScript is an object. Unlike regular objects, functions can be called and have unique properties. All function objects have [[Call]]. Definition of FunctionThere are 4 ways to define a function. Function Declaration / Function Statement 123function add(x, y) { return x + y;} Function Expression 123var add = function (x, y) { return x + y;} Function Constructor 1var add = new Function('x', 'y', 'return x + y'); Arrow Function (ES6) 1var add = (x, y) =&gt; x + y; Each method defines a function, but there is an important difference. Function DeclarationThe function declaration has the same format as the function literal, but the function name can not be omitted. This is because the JavaScript engine needs to create variables with function names. 1234567// Function Declarationfunction add(x, y) { return x + y;}//Function Calladd(2, 3); //5 The function name is an identifier that can be referenced only within the function body. However, when you call a function outside a function, you use the function name. When a function declaration is executed to create a function object, a variable is needed to assign the function object. This is because the function object can not be stored in memory unless it is allocated anywhere. Therefore, the JavaScript engine Implicitly declares an identifier of the same name as the function name Assigns the created function object to the identifier. 123456789// This is the pseudo code when the above function add statement is executed.// variable add is an identifier created by the JavaScript engine with the same name as the function name implicitly. var add = function add(x, y) { return x + y;};add(2, 3); Function name can only be referenced within a function, and implicitly created variable name can be referenced in the scope where the function is defined. This pseudo code is the following function expression. That is, the JavaScript engine converts function declarations into function expressions to create function objects. Function ExpressionFirst-class objectAn object that can be assigned to a variable, such as a value, which can be the value of a property or an element of an array. Function in JavaScript is a first-class object. It means that a function can be freely used as a value. A function object created with a function literal can be assigned to a variable. This way of defining a function is called a function expression. 123456// Function Expressionvar add = function (x, y) { return x + y;};add(2, 3); Unlike function declarations, function literals can omit function names. It is common to use anonymous functions in function expressions. Since a function name is an identifier that can be referenced only by a function body, even if a named function is used, the function must be called with the variable name to which the function object is assigned. Function Creation time and Function HoistingFunction declarations and function expressions seem to behave similarly, because the JavaScript engine implicitly declares the variable as a function name in the function declaration statement and allocates the created object.However, function declaration is non-expression statement, and function expression is an expression statement. Therefore, there is an important difference. The point at which the function is created is when the JavaScript engine evaluates the function declaration to create the function object. Function declaration statements are executed before runtime because they are declarations themselves. However, function expressions are executed at run-time because they are assignment statements that assign function literals to variables. That is, the function created by the function declaration statement and the function generated by the function expression are created at different times. Functions created with function declarations are executed and hoisted before runtime, but functions created with function expressions are not hoisted. Unlike variable hoisting, in the case of function hoisting, a function object is referenced instead of undefined. Function Constructor Constructor FunctionA constructor function is a function that creates an object. The function constructor function, which is a built-in function provided by JavaScript, receives a parameter list and a function body as a string. It is called with the new operator and returns the created function object. 1234// Function Constructorvar add = new Function('x', 'y', 'return x + y');add(2, 3); However, creating a function as a function constructor is not common. These functions behave differently from function declarations or function expressions. Do not use it! Arrow FunctionAn arrow function introduced in ES6 can make a function simply without a function keyword. 1234// Arrow Functionconst add = (x, y) =&gt; x + y;add(2, 3); The arrow function is not available in all situations. Function Call12// Function Calladd(2, 3); add : Variable name referring to function object, not function name ( ) : Function call operator 2, 3 : Arguments to be assigned to the parameter Calling a function stops the current execution flow and passes control to the called function. At this point, arguments are assigned to the parameters and the statements in the function body begin to execute. Parameter and Argument Parameter Declare when defining a function Treated as variables in the function body When a function is called, the parameter is implicitly created in the function body, initialized to undefined, and then an argument is assigned. The scope of the parameter is inside the function. Argument If the argument is passed less than the parameter, the missing parameter has the value undefined. (No error) If the argument is passed in more than the parameter, the excess argument is ignored and kept in the arguments object. Argument Check123456789function add(x, y) { if (typeof x !== 'number' || typeof y !== 'number') throw new TypeError('Non-number type value has assigned to parameter.'); return x + y;}add(2); // TypeError: Non-number type value has assigned to parameter.add('a', 'b'); // TypeError: Non-number type value has assigned to parameter. It is necessary to check whether the argument is passed properly in the JavaScript function. Because.. JavaScript functions do not check that the number of parameters and arguments match. Because JavaScript is a dynamic type language, functions do not specify the type of parameters in advance. Number of parametersThe smaller the number of parameters, the better. A function with 0 parameters is ideal. The more parameters, the more things to consider when using the function, which leads to errors. Also, if the number or sequence of parameters changes, all the code that calls the function must be modified. The ideal function should only do one thing and make it as small as possible. In addition to functions, classes and other functional units must be as clear and small as possible too. External State Changes and Functional ProgrammingSince functions are objects, they follow pass by reference. Passing a value to a function’s parameters is called as Call by value and Call by reference, but the behavior is the same as Pass by value and Pass by reference. As we saw in 10. Comparing primitive and objects, there is a side effect in which the original object is changed by reference values passed from inside the function body to outside of the function. This is called change of external state. Pure function : functions that do not change any external state (No side effect) Impure function : functions that change the external state inside a function (Side effect) Functional programming is a programming paradigm that avoids state changes by suppressing the use of variables and solves complexity by eliminating conditional statements and loops in the logic through the combination of pure and auxiliary functions. Variable values can be changed by someone at any time, and conditional statements or loop statements can make the flow of logic difficult to understand, which can impair readability and become a root cause of errors. Functional programming is a way to avoid errors and increase the stability of programs by minimizing side effects through pure functions. Return StatementThe function returns the execution result through a return statement consisting of the return keyword and the return value. When the return statement is executed, execution of the function is aborted and the function body is exited. If do not write anything after the return keyword or write a return statement, undefined is returned implicitly. Types of various FunctionsIIFE ( Immediately Invoke Function Expression)A function that executes concurrently with the definition of a function. It is common to use anonymous functions and can not be called again once. 123456// Anonymous immediately invoke function(function(){ var a = 2; var b = 3; return a + b;}()); Even if a named function is used, the function name can not be referenced outside of the function and can not be called again. An immediate function must be enclosed in the group operator (). Otherwise, it will not be identified and an error will occur. If put the code in the immediate function, collision of the variable name or the function name can be prevented. An immediate execution function is used for this purpose. Recursive FunctionA recursive call is to call itself. A function that calls itself is called a recursive function. When creating a recursive function, a base case with an escape condition must be included. Stack overflow occurs when a function is called without escaping. Most of what can be implemented as recursive functions can be implemented as loops. Nested Function / Inner FunctionA function defined inside a function is called a nested function (or inner function). A nested function acts as a helper function of an outer function that contains itself. A nested function can access variables of an outer function, but an outer function can not access variables of a nested function. The nesting of functions means the nesting of the scope. Callback FunctionBecause JavaScript functions are first-class objects, can pass functions as arguments to functions. 123456789101112131415161718// Function that recieves calback functionfunction print(f) { var string = 'Good'; // Determine when to call the callback function passed in parameter and call the function return f(string);}// It calls the print function and passes the callback functionvar upper = print(function (str) { return str.toUpperCase();});// It calls the print function and passes the callback functionvar lower = print(function (str) { return str.toLowerCase();});console.log(upper, lower); //GOOD good The function passed to the print function as an argument is called a callback function. The callback function calls the function that receives the callback function as an argument by determining the point of call. Using a callback function is like pushing a nested function depending on your needs and circumstances. Just as a nested function acts as a helper function to help an outer function, the callback function is passed to the function to serve as a helper function. However, since the nested function is fixed and can not be replaced, the callback function can be freely replaced because it is injected as an argument outside the function. When you pass a callback function from the outside, you can create a function that performs various actions depending on the callback function. That is, it is useful to use the callback function in situations where it is changed instead of being fixed like a nested function. Callback functions are mainly used for event handling, Ajax communication, and higher-order functions.","link":"/2019/05/08/11-Function/"},{"title":"15. Property Definition","text":"1. What is Property Definition?프로퍼티 정의란 프로퍼티 어트리뷰트의 값을 정의하여 프로퍼티의 상태를 관리하는 것이다. 예를 들면 프로퍼티 값을 갱신 가능하도록 할 것인지(writable), 프로퍼티를 열거 가능하도록 할 것인지(enumarable), 재정의 가능하도록 할 것인지(configurable)를 정의할 수 있다. 객체 리터럴이 평가되거나 프로퍼티가 동적 생성될 때 프로퍼티가 생성된다. 자바스크립트 엔진은 프로퍼티를 생성할 때 프로퍼티의 상태를 나타내는 프로퍼티 어트리뷰트를 기본값으로 자동 정의한다. 12345678const obj = {};//Dynamic creation of properties. The JavaScript engine creates the property and defines the property's attributes as the default.obj.prop = 10;var descriptor = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(obj, 'prop');console.log(descriptor);// {value: 10, writable: true, enumerable: true, configurable: true} 프로퍼티 동적 생성은 프로퍼티가 존재하지 않을 때 프로퍼티를 생성하여 추가하는 것이다. 프로퍼티 정의는 프로퍼티 어트리뷰트를 정의하는 것을 말한다. 프로퍼티 어트리뷰트는 프로퍼티의 상태를 나타낸다. 프로퍼티의 상태란 프로퍼티의, value writable enumerable configurable 프로퍼티 어트리뷰트는 Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor 메소드를 사용해 참조할 수 있다. 이 메소드는 프로퍼티 어트리뷰트를 객체로 표현한 PropertyDescriptor 객체를 반환한다. 존재하지 않는 프로퍼티나, 상속받은 프로퍼티에 대한 PropertyDescriptor를 요구하면 undefined가 반환된다. 프로퍼티가 동적 생성될 때 자바스크립트 엔진은 프로퍼티 어트리뷰트를 기본값으로 정의한다. 이미 정의된 프로퍼티 어트리뷰트를 재정의할 수도 있다. 2. Internal Slot / MethodInternal slot and internal method는 ECMAScript 스펙에서 요구하는 객체 관련 내부 상태와 내부 동작을 정의한 것이다. ECMAScript 스펙에서 [[...]]로 감싼 이름들이 내부 슬롯과 내부 메소드이다. Internal slot과 method는 자바스크립트 엔진의 내부 구현 사양을 정의한 것이므로 외부에 노출되지 않는다. 객체의 프로퍼티 키로 프로퍼티 값에 접근할 때 [[Get]] 내부 메소드가 내부적으로 호출된다. [[Get]] 내부 메소드는 다음과 같이 동작한다. 프로퍼티 키가 유효한지 확인한다. (문자열 또는 심볼) 프로토타입 체인에서 프로퍼티를 검색한다. Prototype and Prototype Chain프로토타입은 어떤 객체의 parent 객체 역할을 하는 객체이다. 프로토타입은 Child 객체에게 자신의 프로퍼티와 메소드를 상속한다. Prototype객체의 프로퍼티나 메소드를 상속받은 child 객체는 parent 객체의 프로퍼티나 메소드를 자유롭게 사용한다. 프로토타입 체인은 프로토타입 객체가 연결되어있는 상속 구조이다. 어떤 객체의 프로퍼티나 메소드에 접근하려고 할 때, 해당 객체에 접근하려는 프로퍼티나 메소드가 없다면 프로토타입 체인을 따라 상위(부모) 객체의 프로퍼티나 메소드를 차례대로 검색한다. 검색된 프로퍼티가 Data property라면 프로퍼티 값(데이터 프로퍼티의 프로퍼티 어트리뷰트 [[Value]])의 값을 그대로 반환한다. 만약 검색된 프로퍼티가 Accessor property라면 접근자 프로퍼티의 프로퍼티 어트리뷰트 [[Get]]의 값, 즉 getter 함수를 호출하고 그 결과를 반환한다. 함수 객체에는 [[Call]]이라는 고유한 internal method가 있다. [[Call]]은 함수를 호출하면 내부적으로 호출된다. 이는 일반 객체에는 없는 함수 객체만의 고유한 internal method이다. Abstract OperationECMAScript 스펙에서 Abstract operation으로 구현 방향을 제시한다. ECMAScript의 내부 동작을 이해하기 위해서 읽으면 좋음.. 3. Accessor Property프로퍼티는 Data property와 Accessor property로 구분할 수 있다. Data property 키와 값으로 구성된 일반 프로퍼티. 지금까지 살펴본 모든 프로퍼티는 데이터 프로퍼티이다. Accessor property 자체적으로는 값을 갖지 않고 다른 data property의 값을 읽거나 저장할 때 사용되는 Accessor function으로 구성된 프로퍼티 Accessor function은 getter / setter 함수라고도 부른다. 1234567891011121314151617181920212223const student = { // Data property name: 'Park', // Accessor property get infoName() { return this.name; }, set infoName(newName) { this.name = newName; }};// A reference to a property value through a data property.console.log(student); // {name: \"Park\", age: 25}// Setting Property Values with Accessor Properties// If store the value in the accessor property infoName, the setter function is called.student.infoName = 'Kim';console.log(student); // {name: \"Kim\", age: 25}// Getting Property Values with Accessor Propertiesconsole.log(student.infoName); // Kim student 객체의 name은 일반적인 데이터 프로퍼티이다. get infoName은 getter 함수, set infoName은 setter 함수이고 함수의 이름인 infoName이 바로 접근자 프로퍼티이다. 접근자 프로터티는 값([[Value]] attribute)을 가지지 않고 데이터 프로퍼티의 값을 읽거나(get) 저장(set)할 때 동작한다. Accessor property infoName으로 프로퍼티 값에 접근하면 내부적으로 [[Get]] internal method가 호출되어 다음과 같이 동작한다. 프로퍼티 키가 유효한지 확인한다. (문자열 또는 숫자인지) 프로토타입 체인에서 프로퍼티를 검색한다. 검색된 infoName 프로퍼티가 data property인지 accessor property인지 확인한다. infoName은 Accessor property이다. Accessor property infoName의 프로퍼티 어트리뷰트 [[Get]]의 값, 즉 getter 함수를 호출해 결과를 반환한다. 프로퍼티 infoName의 프로퍼티 어트리뷰트 [[Get]]의 값은 Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor 메소드가 반환하는 프로퍼티 디스크립터(PropertyDescriptor) 객체의 get 프로퍼티 값과 같다. Accessor property와 data property의 구별 방법 1234567// The __proto__ of a generic object is an accessor property.Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(Object.prototype, '__proto__');// {get: ƒ, set: ƒ, enumerable: false, configurable: true}// The prototype of a function object is a data property.Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(function() {}, 'prototype');// {value: {…}, writable: true, enumerable: false, configurable: false} Accessor property와 data property의 property descriptor object의 프로퍼티가 다르다. 4. Property Attribute모든 프로퍼티는 자신의 상태와 동작을 정의한 내부 슬롯 / 메소드를 가진다. 이것들을 property attribute라고 한다. Property attribute는 자바스크립트 엔진이 프로퍼티를 생성할 때 default로 자동 정의된다.

C++, Java와 같은 클래스 기반 언어에서 this는 항상 클래스로부터 생성되는 인스턴스를 가리킨다. 그러나 자바스크립트의 this는 함수가 호출되는 방식에 따라서 this에 바인딩될 객체가 동적으로 결정된다. Binding바인딩이란 식별자와 값을 연결하는 과정을 의미한다. 객체 리터럴은 할당 단계에 평가되므로 객체의 식별자를 this 대신 사용할 수 있지만, 일반적이지 않다. 생성자를 이용해서 객체를 생성할 때는 인스턴트를 가리킬 식별자를 미리 알 수 없기 때문이다. this는 객체의 프로퍼티나 메소드를 참조하기 위한 변수이므로 객체의 메소드 또는 생성자 함수에서만 의미가 있다. strict mode가 적용된 일반 함수 내부의 this에는 undefined가 바인딩 된다. 적용되지 않을 경우 일반 함수 내부에서 this는 전역 객체 window를 가리킨다. strict mode‘use strict’; strict mode는 자바스크립트 언어의 문법을 보다 엄격히 적용하여 기존에는 무시되던 오류를 발생시킬 가능성이 높거나 자바스크립트 엔진의 최적화 작업에 문제를 일으킬 수 있는 코드에 대해 명시적인 에러를 발생시킨다. 2. Function call types and this Binding스코프의 경우 렉시컬 스코프(Lexical Scope)는 함수 정의가 평가되어 함수 객체가 생성되는 시점에 상위 스코프가 결정된다. this에 바인딩될 객체는 함수 호출 시점에 결정된다. 함수 호출 방식은 다음과 같다. 일반 함수 호출 : this는 window 메소드 호출 : this는 메소드를 호출한 객체 생성자 함수 호출 : this는 생성할 instance Function.prototype.apply/call/bind 메소드에 의한 간접 호출 (??) 2.1. General Function Call일반 함수로 호출된 함수 내부의 this에는 전역 객체(Global Object)가 바인딩된다. 전역 함수는 물론 중첩 함수를 일반 함수로 호출했을 때에도 함수 내부의 this에는 전역 객체가 바인딩된다. 일반 함수에서는 this로 객체의 프로퍼티나 메소드를 참조할 일이 없으므로 this에 의미가 없다. 12345678function foo() { console.log('foo this: ', this); // window function bar() { console.log('bar this: ', this); // window } bar();}foo(); 메소드 내에서 정의한 중첩 함수일지라도 일반 함수로 호출되면 중첩 함수의 this는 전역 객체이다. 123456789101112const obj = { foo() { console.log('foo this: ', this); // {foo: f} function bar() { console.log('bar this: ', this); // window } // 메소드 내부에서 정의한 중첩 함수라도 일반 함수로 호출하면 this에 전역 객체가 바인딩된다. bar(); }};obj.foo(); 마찬가지로 콜백 함수 내부의 this에도 전역 객체가 바인딩된다. 정리하면 일반 함수로 호출된 모든 함수(중첩 함수, 콜백 함수 포함) 내부의 this에는 전역 객체가 바인딩된다. 메소드 내부의 중첩 함수나 콜백 함수의 this 바인딩을 메소드의 this 바인딩과 일치시키기 위한 방법은 다음과 같다. this를 변수에 저장하고 콜백 함수의 this를 변수로 대체 123456789const obj = { value: 100, foo() { cosnt that = this; setTimeout(function () { console.log(that.value); // 100 }, 100) }}; Function.prototype.apply, Function.prototype.call, Function.prototype.bind 메소드 이용 123456789const obj = { value: 100, foo() { // bind method의 argument를 콜백 함수의 this로 바인딩한다. setTimeout(function () { console.log(this.value); // 100 }.bind(this), 100) }}; 2.2. Method Call메소드 내부의 this는 메소드를 호출한 객체, 즉 메소드 호출시 (.) 연산자 앞에 오는 객체에 바인딩된다. 메소드를 소유한 객체가 아닌, 메소드를 호출한 객체에 바인딩된다는 것을 주의해야 한다. 123456789101112131415161718function Person(name) { this.name = name;}Person.prototype.getName = function () { return this.name;};const me = new Person('Park');const you = { name: 'Kim'};you.getName = me.getName;console.log(me.getName()); // \"Park\"console.log(you.getName()); // \"Kim\" 2.3. Constructor Function Call생성자 함수 내부의 this에는 생성자 함수가 생성할 instance가 바인딩된다. 생성자 함수는 객체(instance)를 생성하는 함수로, new 연산자와 함께 호출되면 빈 객체를 만들고 this에 바인딩한다. 연산을 하며 this 객체를 완성시킨 후 this를 리턴한다. 함수가 new 연산자와 함께 호출되지 않아 일반 함수로 동작할 경우 this는 전역 객체를 가리킨다. 2.4. Indirect Call by Function.prototype.apply / call / bind methodapply, callFunction.prototype의 메소드 apply와 call은 argument로 this와 arguments list를 전달받아 함수를 호출한다. Function 생성자 함수를 constructor 프로퍼티로 가리키는 모든 함수가 Function.prototype.apply와 call을 상속받아 사용할 수 있다. 1234567/** * 주어진 this 바인딩과 인수 리스트 배열을 사용하여 함수를 호출한다. * @param thisArg - this로 사용될 객체 * @param argsArray - 함수에게 전달할 인수 리스트 배열 * @returns 호출된 함수의 반환값 */Function.prototype.apply(thisArg, [argsArray])) 1234567/** * 주어진 this 바인딩과 인수 리스트를 사용하여 함수를 호출한다. * @param thisArg - this로 사용될 객체 * @param arg1, arg2, ... - 함수에게 전달할 인수 리스트 * @returns 호출된 함수의 반환값 */Function.prototype.call(thisArg, arg1, arg2, ...)) 두 메소드의 차이는, apply 메소드는 호출할 함수의 arguments를 배열로 묶어 전달한다. call 메소드는 호출할 함수의 arguments를 쉼표로 구분한 리스트 형식으로 전달한다. apply와 call은 호출할 함수에 argument를 전달하는 방식만 다를 뿐, this로 사용할 객체와 argument를 전달하며 함수를 호출한다. bindbind 메소드는 메소드의 this와, 메소드 내부의 중첩함수 또는 콜백 함수의 this가 불일치하는 문제를 해결할 때 사용된다. 콜백 함수 foo는 외부 함수 callName을 돕는 헬퍼 함수(보조 함수)의 역할을 해야하기 때문에 외부 함수 내부의 this와 콜백함수 내부의 this가 다르면 문제가 발생한다. 이 때 bind 메소드를 사용해서 this를 일치시킨다. apply와 call 메소드 또한 사용할 수 있다. 12345678910111213function Person(name) { this.name = name;}Person.prototype.callName = function (callback) { callback.bind(this)(); // callback.apply(this); // callback.apply(this);}function foo() { console.log(this.name);} bind로 this를 전달한 callback을 실행할 수도 있고, apply나 call로 this를 전달하며 동시에 호출할 수도 있다. 정리하면 this 바인딩은 다음과 같이 실행된다. 함수 호출 방식 this 바인딩 일반 함수 호출 전역 객체 메소드 호출 메소드를 호출한 객체 생성자 함수 호출 생성자 함수가 생성할 instance Function.prototype.apply/call/bind 메소드에 의한 간접 호출 Function.prototype.apply/call/bind 메소드에 argument로 전달한 객체","link":"/2019/05/15/20-this/"},{"title":"21.

Primitive type이 wrapper 객체의 메소드를 사용할 수 있는 이유: primitive type으로 wrapper 객체의 프로퍼티나 메소드를 호출할 때 일시적으로 해당 타입과 연관된 wrapper 객체로 변환해 프로토타입 객체를 공유하기 때문. 1.1 Number ConstructorNumber 객체는 Number() 생성자 함수를 통해 생성한다. 1234567const x = new Number(123);const y = new Number('123');const z = new Number('string');console.log(x); // 123console.log(y); // 123console.log(z); // NaN new 연산자 없이 Number() 함수를 사용하면 Number 객체가 아니라 primitive type number를 반환한다. 1234567const x = Number(123);const y = Number('123');const z = Number('string');console.log(x); // 123console.log(y); // 123console.log(z); // NaN 이를 이용해 형변환을 할 수 있다. 1.2.

Data Type","text":"What is Data Type?Data Type is type of values. All of the data in JavaScript have data type. Allocatation of memory space by Data TypeAll of values used in programming language can be stored in memory and referenced. To store values in memory, computer need to know the size of memory space it need. Because size of memory depends on data type. JavaScript uses a double-precision 64-bit floating-point format when creating numeric binary values. Access memory by Data TypeWhen refer to memory space by identifier, computer need to know the size of memory it need to read once. If variable soup is Number type, computer should access memory by only 8 byte. Data Type provides that informations to computer and human. Here’s reasons why Data Type need: To determine the size of memory space that must be free when storing values To determine how much memory space should be read at once when referring to a value To determine how to interpret the binary be read from memory. (To Number, String etc.) ValueValue is one of expression that can not be evaluated any more. The expression is statement that makes value. In other words, expression make value by being evaluated. 12// 1 + 2 is an expression. And this expression evaluated and make a value 3.1 + 2 1 + 2 is an expression. It is made up of value 1, 2 and operator +. The expression is evaluated by the JavaScript engine to produce a new value of 3. In other words, expression 1 + 2 is equivalent with value 3. The newly created value of 3 can not be evaluated anymore. When you evaluate 3, it is always 3. 12// The variable is assigned the value 3, which is the evaluated value of expression 1 + 2.var sum = 1 + 2; After the assignment operator =, value must be located. The expression creates value. So the expression can be located after operator =. Function in JavaScript is an object. And an object is a value. So function also can be evaluated to a value. Creation of ValueValue can created by many expressions. The most basic method to create value is using literal notation. The expression is more comprehensive concept that includes literal notation, identifier expression, etc. LiteralA literal is a fixed value itself created directly in the source code. More specifically, literal values are evaluated by the JavaScript engine. Literal notation creates literal. Literal notation is method that make literal. The literal notation allows the generation of various types of values (Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined, object, array, function, regular expression, etc.) available in JavaScript. When JavaScript engines meet codes written in literal notation, they interpret the literal at the time the code is executed (runtime) and generate values. Literal is the most basic method to generates value. 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435363738394041// Integer literal10// Floating point literal10.2// Binary literal0b011010101// Octal literal0o010101// Hexa literal0xd100ff// String literal'Hello'\"Subin\"``// Boolean literaltruefalse// null literalnull// undefined literalundefined// Object literal{ name: 'Park', color: 'yellow' }// Array literal[ 1, 2, 3]// Function literalfunction(){}// Regular expression literal/ab+c/ Literal notation can be understood as a promise between the JavaScript engine and the developer. The JavaScript engine can interpret literal notation. For example, if you want to generate a numeric value, the developer uses the numeric literal notation to ask the JavaScript engine to generate a numeric value. The JavaScript engine responds to the developer’s request to interpret numeric literals and generate numeric values. Relation of Value and Literal1var soup = 100; At the right side, 100 is directly created literal by literal notation. This literal is both literal and value at the same time because it cannot be evaluated any more and can be assigned to variable. Another example, 1var soup = 50 + 50; At the right side, 50 made by literal notation and + operator was used to sum. This expression create a new value 100. As such, statement that generates value in program called expression. The right side of this code is expression and generates a new value 100. So 50 is literal but created value 100 is not a literal, a value. A literal can be a value in itself, but not all values are literal. ExpressionsA value can be generated by various methods. Various methods are expressions. The expression refers to combination of literal, identifier(variable name, function name), operator and function calls. The expression generate one value as a result of evaluation. In the other words, the expression is a statement that can be evaluated to one value. Everything that produces a value is an expression. 1234567891011121314151617// literal notation10'Hello'// identifier expression(Assuming that a declaration already exists)sumperson.namearr[1]// operator expression10 + 20sum = 10 //assignment statementsum !== 10// function/method call expression(Assuming that a declaration already exists)square()person.getName() The assignment statement is evaluated as a assigned value. Classification of Data typesAll of the values in JavaScript have a data type. JavaScript provides 7 data types. 7 data types can be classified into primitive types and object(reference) types. Primitive type Number type : Number(Integer and Real number) String type : Strings Boolean type : logical true and false undefined type : The implicitly assigned value that declared but not explicitly assigned null type : The value used to indicate intentionally that there is no value. Symbol type : Seventh type that newly introduced in ES6 Object /reference type Object, funtcions, array etc. For example, Number 1 and String ‘1’ are look similar but completely different values. Size of memory space that needs to be occupied is different, binary digits that are stored in memory is different, and method of reading and interpreting is different. Also the purpose of value is different. Number type values are for arithmetic operation and String type values are for printing out text to screen. As such, developers will create values by distinguishing between types with clear intentions and JavaScript engines will treat values by distinguishing between types. Number TypeIn C and Java, they distinguish integer and real number so there are various number types like int, long, float, double. But JavaScript has only one Number type. As ECMAScript specification, Number type follows double-precision 64-bit floating-point format(numbers between -(253 -1) ~ 253 -1 ). JavaScript treats all of the Numbers as real number, has no integer type. Special number types Infinity : positive infinity -Infinity : negative infinity NaN : no arithmetic operation(not-a-number) Infinity is not a mathematical term, but a number that goes beyond what JavaScript can express. JavaScript is case-sensitive so NaN != nan, NAN, naN, Nan. String TypeThe String type is used to refer text data. String is a collection of more than 0 16 bit Unicode characters (UTF-16) that can represent most of the world’s characters. How to know the size of String?The purpose of Data Type is to determine the size of memory space that must be free when storing values and to determine how much memory space should be read at once when referring to a value. String can be generated by ‘’, “”, . The most general expression is using ‘’. 12345678// String Typevar string;string = \"문자열\"; // double quotesstring = '문자열'; // single quotesstring = `문자열`; // backtickstring = \"A 'single quote' in a string enclosed in double quotes is recognized as a string.\";string = 'The \"double quotes\" in strings enclosed in single quotes are recognized as strings.'; Unlike languages such as C and Java, JavaScript strings are primitive types and are immutable values. Immutable means that once a string is generated, it cannot be changed. Template literalES6 introduced new string expression, called template literal. Template literal seems like general string, it uses backtick (`). In a typical string, the line is not allowed and in order to represent a white space, an escape sequence beginning with a backslash () must be used. Unlike a typical string, ES6 template literal can write strings across multiple lines, and all spaces within the template literal apply as they are. 12345678const template = `&lt;ul class=\"nav-items\"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"#home\"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"#news\"&gt;News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"#contact\"&gt;Contact&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"#about\"&gt;About&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;`;console.log(template); And Strings can be concatenated using the + string operator. The + operator concatenate operands if at least one of the operand is a String. 12345var first = 'Subin';var last = 'Park';// ES5: String Concatenationconsole.log('My name is ' + first + ' ' + last + '.'); Template literal provides String Interpolation to insert new string without using + string operator. 12345var first = 'Subin';var last = 'Park';// ES6: String Interpolationconsole.log(`My name is ${first} ${last}.`); String Interpolation wraps expression with ${ extension}. The evaluation results of the expression are then forced to type into a string. 1console.log(`1 + 1 = ${1 + 1}`); The sequence is that Number 1 + 1 evaluated to Number 2, and be type casted to String 2. Boolean TypeThe boolean type values are only true and false. It is used to condition statement as a flow control. undefined TypeThe value of undefined type is unique, a undefined. The implicitly assigned value that declared but not explicitly assigned. If the value of variable is undefined, it means that the variable only be declared but not be assigned yet. Declaration and Definitionundefined means not defined. The definition refers to clarifying the substance of a variable by assigning a value to the variable. In C, definition of variable is important because if the variable only declared but not assigned, it can be contain a garbage value. But JavaScript assign undefined when at the time a variable is declared. In JavaScript, the boundaries between declarations and definitions are ambiguous and do not distinguish between them. null TypeThe value of null type is unique, a null. JavaScript is case-sensitive so null != Null, NULL. In programming language, null is used to represent intentional absence. However, assigning null to a variable is not used very well. If the function can not return a valid value, it may explicitly return null. For example, Document.getElementById(id) return null if given id is not exist in document. Object TypeAll of the JavaScript data type excepts primitive types are object type. Dynamic TypingStatic type languageStatic / Strong type languages ​​such as C or Java must declare a data type in advance. This is called an explicit type declaration. The following is an example of declaring an integer type variable in C. 12345// 4 byte integer typeint num;// 1 byte integer typechar c; Static type language can not change a type of value and only can assign values that match the type declared in the variable. Representative static type languages are C, C++, Java, Kotlin, Go, Hashell, Rust, Scala etc. Dynamic type languageJavaScript does not declare the type of variable when declaration. But only use the keywords such as var, let, const to declare a variable. JavaScript can assign any type of values. 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526var foo;console.log(typeof foo); // undefinedfoo = 3;console.log(typeof foo); // numberfoo = 'Hello';console.log(typeof foo); // stringfoo = true;console.log(typeof foo); // booleanfoo = null;console.log(typeof foo); // objectfoo = Symbol(); // symbolconsole.log(typeof foo); // symbolfoo = {}; // objectconsole.log(typeof foo); // objectfoo = []; // arrayconsole.log(typeof foo); // objectfoo = function () {}; // 함수console.log(typeof foo); // function A static type language determines the type of a variable at the time of variable declaration and can not change the type of a variable. JavaScript can dynamically determine the type of the variable at the time of assigning the value and change the type of the variable at any time. In other words, JavaScript variables are type-determined by assignments rather than declarations. And the type of variable can be changed by reassignment at any time. This feature is called Dynamic Typing, and JavaScript is called a Dynamic / weak type language to distinguish it from Static type languages. Typical dynamic type languages ​​are JavaScript, Python, PHP, Ruby, Lisp, and Perl. Parameter and Argument12345678// x, y: parameterfunction add(x, y){ // type check is needed return x, y;}// 1, 2: argumentadd(1, 2) A parameter is a variable in a method definition. When a method is called, the arguments are the data you pass into the method’s parameters. Parameter is variable in the declaration of function. Argument is the actual value of this variable that gets passed to function. Things to keep in mind when using variables Actively reduce the use of variables. The greater the number of variables, the higher the probability of error occurrence. Do not use global variables. Make the life cycle of the variable as short as possible. Use a constant rather than a variable to suppress the change of value. Use const instead let if a variable is never reassigned. The variable name is named so that the reason for the existence of the variable can be grasped. Reference Data type &amp; Variable","link":"/2019/04/30/5-Data-Type/"},{"title":"6. Operator","text":"Expression and OperatorOperator needs operand as value. And the expression is equivalent with value. So expressions can be located Values ​​can be generated in a variety of ways. The various methods mentioned here are expressions. Expressions in a programming language have a very important meaning. Expression is combination of tokens(literal, identifier(variable name, function name, etc), operator, function call). The expression is evaluated to produce a single value. That is, an expression is a statement that can be evaluated as a single value. Expression can be divided into a literal notation, an identifier expression, an operator expression, a function/method call expression, but they are all the same in that they are evaluated and made into a single value. The value that generated by evaluation of an expression is equivalent with an expression. In other words, expressions can be used like values. This means that an expression can also be placed where the value can be placed. 1234var x = 10;// expression x + 30 consists of a combination of an identifier expression(x), number literal(30) and operator(+)console.log(x + 30); //40 Statement and ExpressionA statement is a command to a JavaScript engine that consists of a combination of one or more expressions and keywords. A program is made up of a set of statements, and programming is to write the statements and sequence them. A statement can be divided into declare statement expression statement conditional statement loop statement. Statement should end up with semicolon(;). Do not add a semicolon after the code block. All codes of JavaScript are statements. An expression can itself be a statement. But the statement can not be an expression. It is difficult that distinguish statement and expression. The expression evaluates to produce a value, but can not do anything further. The statement can be used to create variables, functions, and classes using declarative keywords such as var, let, const, function (declare statement), and class and to control the program flow by generating conditional statements such as if, for, and while statements. The role of expression is that generates value. The role of statement is that command to JavaScript engine using a value that is generated by expression. Expression statement and Non-expression statementThere are expression statement and non-expression statement. A expression statement is a statement that can be evaluated as a value, and non-expression statement is a statement that can not be evaluated as a value. For example, assignment statement can not be evaluated as a value. So it’s non-expression statement. The simplest and most obvious way to distinguish expressions from expressions is to assign them to variables. An expression statement can be evaluated as value so it can be assigned to a variable. 12345678910111213141516171819202122// declare statement : non-expression statement&gt; var x;&lt; undefined// assignment statement : expression statement&gt; x = 5;&lt; 5// function declare statement : non-expression statement&gt; function foo(){}&lt; undefined// conditional statement : non-expression statement&gt; if(x &gt;= 5) { console.log(x); } 5&lt; undefined// loop statement&gt; for (var i = 0; i &lt; 2; i++) { console.log(i); } 0 1&lt; undefined Expression always prints a evaluated value in Chrome developer tool. What is Operator?An operator creates one value by performing arithmetic, assignment, comparison, logic, and type operations on one or more expressions. operand : the object of the operation The operand is also an expression because it is evaluated and a single value, and the expression is also an expression that combines the operand with the operator. Arithmetic OperatorThe Arithmetic Operator performs a mathematical computation on the operands to produce new numeric values. If arithmetic is not possible, NaN is returned. Arithmetic operators can be classified into binary arithmetic operators and unary arithmetic operators according to the number of operands. Binary Arithmetic OperatorThe binary arithmetic operator creates one Number type value by operating arithmetic on two operands. All binary arithmetic operators have no side effects that change the value of the operand. In other words, any arithmetic operation does not change the value of the operand. It always creates new values. Binary arithmetic operator Meaning Side effect + Addition X - Subtraction X * Multiplication X / Division X % Remainder X Unary Arithmetic OperatorUnary arithmetic operators perform arithmetic operations on a single operand to produce a numeric type value. The increment / decrement (++ / –) operator has side effects that change the value of the operand. Unary arithmetic operator Meaning Side effect ++ Increment O – Decrement O + No effect. Negative numbers are not reversed to positive numbers. X - Returns a positive number that is a negative number and a negative number that is a positive number. X The position of increment/decrement(++/–) operator has meaning. The prefix increment / decrement operator that located before the operand first increments / decrements the value of the operand, and then performs another operation. The postfix increment / decrement operator that located after the operand first performs other operation, and then increments / decrements the value of the operand. String Concatenation OperatorThe + operator acts as a string concatenation operator if at least one of the operands is a string. 12console.log('1' + 2); //12console.log(1 + '2'); //12 This is an implicit type coercion by the JavaScript engine, regardless of the developer’s intent. Assignment OperatorAssignment Operator assign the operand at right side to the variable at left side. The assignment operator changes the value of a variable by assigning it a value. Assignment Operator Example Same Expression Side Effect = x = 5 x = 5 O += x += 5 x = x + 5 O -= x -= 5 x = x - 5 O *= x *= 5 x = x * 5 O /= x /= 5 x = x / 5 O %= x %= 5 x = x % 5 O An assignment operation is an expression that evaluates to a single value. The assignment expression is evaluated to the assigned value. Comparison OperatorComparison Operator compares the left and right operands, and then returns a Boolean value. Comparison operators are often used in conditional expressions of control statements such as if statements and for statements. Loose Equality Operator and Strict Equality OperatorLoose equality operator and strict equality operator are both returns the Boolean value by comparing whether the left operand and the right operand have the same value. Loose equality operator (==) : loose comparison Strict equality operator (===) : strict comparison Equality Operator Meaning Example Explanation Side Effect == Loose equality comparison x == y values of x and y are equal X === Strict equality comparison x === y both value and type of x and y are equal X != Loose inequality comparison x != y values of x and y are different X !== Strict inequality comparison x !== y value and type of x and y are different X Loose equality operator (==) compares the types by implicit type conversion and then compares them with the same value. Thus, the loose equality operator returns true if the operand of the left and right terms is the same value after the implicit type conversion, even if the type is different. Strict equality operator (===) return false if the types of operands are different. But NaN is the only value that does not match itself. 12// NaN is the only value that does not match itself.console.log(NaN === NaN); //false Use the built-in function isNaN to check if a number is NaN. 1console.log(isNaN(NaN)); //true Relational Operators Relational Operator Name Example Side Effect &gt; Greater than operator x &gt; y X &lt; Less than operator x &lt; y X >= Greater than or equal operator x &gt;= y X &lt;= Less than or equal operator x &lt;= y X Conditional Ternary OperatorThe ternary operator determines the value to return based on the evaluation of the conditional expression. It is the only ternary operator in JavaScript and has no side effects. 1Conditional expression ? return value when the conditional expression is true : return value when the conditional expression is false If the evaluation result of the conditional expression is not a Boolean value, it is implicitly typed as a Boolean value. Conditional ternary operator expressions are expressions that can be evaluated as values. Therefore, the conditional ternary operator expression can be part of another expression and is very useful. Logical Operator OR || Return true if only one operand is true AND &amp;&amp; Return false if any operand is false NOT ! Return true if operand is false, Return false if operand is true The logical OR operator and logical AND operator do not return only the boolean result of the operation. It returns one of the operands. But the NOT operator must return a boolean. 123console.log('Cat' &amp;&amp; 'Dog'); // 'Dog'console.log('Cat' || 'Dog'); // 'Cat'console.log(!'Cat'); //false Comma OperatorComma(,) operator evaluate from the left operand in turn, return the result of the last operand and return the result. 12var x, y, z;x = 1, y = 2, z = 3; Group OperatorGroup operator () evaluates the expression that is the operand first. Therefore, group operators can be used to control the priority of operators. typeof OperatorThe typeof operator returns the string as the data type of the operand after itself. The string returned by the typeof operator does not match the 7 data types. The typeof operator returns one of the 7 strings “string”, “number”, “boolean”, “undefined”, “symbol”, “object”, or “function” It does not return “null”; it returns “function” for functions. 123456789101112typeof '' // \"string\"typeof 1 // \"number\"typeof NaN // \"number\"typeof true // \"boolean\"typeof undefined // \"undefined\"typeof Symbol() // \"symbol\"typeof null // \"object\"typeof [] // \"object\"typeof {} // \"object\"typeof new Date() // \"object\"typeof /test/gi // \"object\"typeof function () {} // \"function\" Since typeof null is an object, when checking null, use === operator. 1234var foo = null; console.log(typeof foo === null); // falseconsole.log(foo === null); // true If an identifier not declared by the typeof operator is computed, it returns “undefined”.","link":"/2019/05/01/6-Operator/"},{"title":"Responsive Web (1)","text":"반응형 웹 | Responsive Web Design 웹 환경의 변화 : Mobile Device의 등장 초기 모바일 환경을 위해 mobile 화면을 별도 구성 &gt; 비용과 유지보수 측면에서 risk 크다.

Object-Oriented Programming이전에 포스팅한 객체 지향 프로그래밍 포스팅을 참고 4 Fundamental of Object Oriented Programming 객체지향 프로그래밍은 프로그래밍을 명령어 또는 함수의 목록으로 보는 명령형 프로그래밍의 절차지향적 관점에서 벗어나 프로그램을 여러개의 독립적 객체들의 집합으로 표현하려는 프로그래밍 패러다임을 말한다. 객체지향 프로그래밍에는 몇 가지 원칙이 있다. 추상화 (abstraction) : 다양한 속성 중에서 프로그램에 필요한 속성만을 간추려내어 표현하는 것을 추상화라고 한다. 불필요한 정보는 숨기고 필요한 정보만을 표현함으로써 공토 캡슐화 (encapsulation) : 모든 객체가 자신의 상태(state, private variavles)를 클래스 내부에 private으로 보유함으로써 지켜진다. 내부 상태를 내부 메소드로만 접근할 수 있게 한다. 상속 (inheritance) : 객체지향 프로그래밍의 핵심 개념으로 부모 객체의 프로퍼티를 자식 개체가 상속받아 그대로 사용할 수 있는 것을 말한다. 다형성 (polymorpism) : 부모 객체가 선언한 interface 메소드를 자식 객체가 재정의(overiding) 함으로써 하나의 interface로 상황에 따라 기능을 달리 하는 것을 말한다. 2. Inheritance and Prototype자바스크립트의 상속은 프로토타입(prototype)을 기반으로 구현된다. 상속을 사용해야 하는 이유는, 동일한 프로퍼티 구조를 갖는 객체를 여러개 만들 때 모든 인스턴스가 동일한 메소드를 중복 소유하는 것은 메모리적 관점에서 비효율적이기 때문이다. 상속을 사용하면 하나의 프로토타입을 생성해 모든 인스턴스가 공유할 수 있다. 인스턴스를 생성할 때마다 메소드를 생성하므로 퍼포먼스적으로도 비효율적이다. 상속은 코드의 재사용이란 관점에서 유용하다. 공통적으로 사용할 프로퍼티나 메소드를 프로토타입에 미리 구현해놓으면 생성되는 인스턴스는 메소드 생성 없이 미리 구현된 프로토타입의 프로퍼티를 사용할 수 있다. 12345678910111213141516function Circle(radius) { this.radius = radius;}// Add getGeometer method to Circle's prototype object(prototype).// The prototype is bound to the prototype property of the Circle constructor function.Circle.prototype.getGeometer = function () { return 2 * this.radius;};const circle1 = new Circle(2);const circle2 = new Circle(5);// All instances of Circle constuctor have same prototype(Circle constuctor function's prototype proeprety).console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(circle1) === Object.getPrototypeOf(circle2)) // trueconsole.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(circle1) === Circle.prototype) // true 3. prototype ObjectPrototype Object(prototype)는 Object간의 상속을 구현하기 위해 사용된다. 프로토타입은 어떤 object의 Parent obect 역할을 하는 객체로, 다른 객체에 Shared property를 제공한다. Prototype을 상속받은 Child object는 Parent object의 프로퍼티를 자신의 프로퍼티처럼 사용할 수 있다. 모든 객체는 [[Prototype]] 내부 슬롯을 가지며, 내부 슬롯의 값으로 프로토타입 객체의 참조를 저장한다. 프로토타입은 객체의 생성 방식에 의해 결정된다. 객체 리터럴로 생성된 객체의 프로토타입은 Object.prototype이고, 생성자 함수에 의해 생성된 객체의 프로토타입은 자신을 생성한 함수의 prototype 프로퍼티이다. 모든 객체는 하나의 프로토타입을 가지며 모든 프로토타입은 생성자 함수와 연결되어 있다. 이는 객체와 프로토타입, 생성자 사이를 연결한다.

Internal Method [[GetPrototypeOf]] &amp; [[SetPrototypeOf]]get proto 는 자신의 프로토타입 취득시 [[GetPrototypeOf]] 내부 메소드를 호출 set proto 는 새로운 프로토타입 할당시 [[SetPrototypeOf]] 내부 메소드를 호출 코드 내에서 __proto__ 접근자 프로퍼티 직접 사용 자제코드 내에서 __proto__ 직접 사용하는 것 대신 Object.getPrototypeOf, Object.setPrototypeOf 메소드를 사용하는 것을 권장한다. 12345function Person(name) { this.name = name;}console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(Person) === Person.__proto__); // true __proto__ 접근자 프로퍼티는 상속을 통해 사용됨__proto__ 접근자 프로퍼티는 객체가 직접 소유하는 프로퍼티가 아닌, Object.prototype으로부터 상속받은 프로퍼티이다. 모든 객체는 상속을 통해서 Object.prototype. proto 접근자 프로퍼티를 사용할 수 있다. Prototype Chain모든 객체는 프로토타입 계층 구조인 프로토타입 체인에 묶여있다. 자바스크립트는 객체의 프로퍼티(메소드 포함)에 접근하려고 할 때 __proto__ 접근자 프로퍼티가 가리키는 링크를 따라서 부모 프로토타입의 프로퍼티를 검색한다. 프로토타입 체인의 최상위 객체는 Object.prototype이다. 모든 객체는 Object.prototype 객체를 상속하므로 Object.prototype의 프로퍼티를 사용할 수 있다. __proto__ 접근자 프로퍼티를 통해서 프로토타입에 접근하는 이유__proto__ 접근자 프로퍼티를 통해서 프로토타입에 접근하면 객체들이 서로가 자신의 프로토타입이 되어 순환 참조적 프로토타입 체인이 만들어지지 않도록 에러를 발생시킨다. 프로토타입 체인이 cyclic하게 되면 프로퍼티 검색시 무한 루프에 빠진다. 즉, Object.prototype의 set __proto__() (setter function)이 객체가 프로토타입을 상호참조할 때 에러를 발생시킨다. 3.2. Function Object’s prototype Property함수 객체는 __proto__ 접근자 프로퍼티 외에 prototype 프로퍼티도 소유한다. __proto__는 모든 객체가 가지는 자신의 프로토타입 접근자 프로퍼티이고, prototype 프로퍼티는 함수 객체가 자신이 생성할 인스턴스에 할당하는 프로토타입이다. 구분 prototype 프로퍼티 __proto__ 접근자 프로퍼티 소유 함수 객체 모든 객체 값 프로토타입의 참조값 프로토타입의 참조값 사용 주체 생성자 함수 모든 객체 사용 목적 자신이 생성할 객체의 프로토타입을 할당하기 위해 사용 자신의 프로토타입에 접근하기 위해서 사용 3.3. Prototype’s constructor Property and the Constructor Function함수 객체가 소유한 prototype 프로퍼티는 상속할 프로토타입을 가리킨다. 모든 프로토타입은 constructor 프로퍼티를 갖는다. constructor 프로퍼티는 prototype 프로퍼티로 자신을 참조하고 있는 생성자 함수를 가리킨다. 생성자 함수가 생성될 때 암묵적으로 프로토타입과 생성자 함수 간의 연결이 이루어진다. 4. Constructor Functions and Prototypes of Objects Created by Literal Notation생성자 함수로 만들지 않은 객체도 Object.prototype을 상속받아야하므로 Object constructor function과도 연결된다. 프로토타입과 생성자 함수는 언제나 pair로 존재해야 하기 때문에 리터럴 표기법에 의해 생성된 객체는 엄밀히 말하면 생성자 함숭 의해 생성된 객체가 아니지만, 생성자 함수의 프로토타입과 연결된다. Literal Notation Constructor Function Prototype Object Literal Object Object.prototype Function Literal Function Function.prototype Array Literal Array Array.prototype RegExp Literal RegExp RegExp.prototype 5. When will prototypes be created?위에서 리터럴 표기법에 의해서 생성된 객체도 생성자 함수와 연결되는 것을 알아보았다. 생성자 함수는 사용자 정의 생성자 함수와 자바스크립트 built-in 생성자 함수로 구분할 수 있다. 프로토타입은 생성자 함수가 생성되는 시점에 생성된다. 5.1. User Defined Constructor Function and Prototype Creation화살표 함수나 ES6의 메소드 축약 표현으로 정의하지 않고 일반적으로 정의(함수 선언문, 함수 표현식)한 함수는 내부 메소드 [[Constructor]]가 구현되어 new 연산자와 함께 호출하면 생성자 함수로 호출할 수 있다. 생성자 함수로 호출할 수 있는 constructor는 함수 객체가 생성될 때 프로토타입도 함께 생성된다. 함수 객체는 함수 정의가 평가될 때 생성된다. 123456// 함수 정의는 Hoisting되어 런타임 이전에 함수 객체를 생성하므로 Student.prototype도 함께 생성되어있다.console.log(Student.prototype);function Student(name) { this.name = name;} 함수의 생성 시점 함수 선언문으로 정의한 함수 함수 선언문으로 정의한 함수는 자바스크립트 엔진이 런타임 이전에 모든 선언문을 미리 실행할 때 평가되어 함수 객체가 된다. 이 때 생성된 함수 객체는 암묵적으로 함수명과 동일한 이름을 가진 변수에 할당된다. 함수 표현식으로 정의한 함수 함수 표현식으로 정의한 함수는 런타입에 변수에 할당될 때, 즉 런타임에 할당문이 실행되는 시점에 평가되어 함수 객체가 된다. 5.2. Built-in Constructor Function and Prototype CreationObject, Function, Number, String, Array, RegExp, Date, Promise 등과 같은 built-in 생성자 함수도 마찬가지로 built-in 생성자 함수가 생성되는 시점에 프로토타입이 같이 생성된다. 모든 built-in 생성자 함수는 전역 객체(window)가 생성되는 시점에 생성된다. 전역 객체는 웹 애플리케이션 실행시 가장 처음으로 생성된다. 웹 애플리케이션 실행시 전역 객체 window 가 만들어지고, built-in 생성자 함수들이 만들어짐과 동시에 프로토타입 객체도 생성되어 built-in 생성자 함수의 prototype 프로퍼티에 바인딩된다. 6. How to Create an Object and Determine its Prototype객체는 다양한 방식으로 생성할 수 있다. 객체 리터럴 Object 생성자 함수 생성자 함수 Object.create 메소드 클래스 (ES6) 객체 리터럴로 생성하는 방식이 가장 간단한 객체 생성 방식이다. 객체 생성방식은 여러가지지만 모두 추상 연산 ObjectCreate에 의해 생성된다. 추상 연산 ObjectCreate는 필수로 자신이 생성할 객체의 프로토타입을 argument로 전달받는다. 추상 연산 ObjectCreate는 객체를 생성한 후 인수로 전달받은 프로토타입을 자신이 생성한 객체의 [[Prototype]] 내부 슬롯에 할당한 후, 생성한 객체를 반환한다. ObjectCreate의 proto parameter로 전달될 argument는 객체가 생성되는 시점에, 객체 생성 방식에 따라서 결정된다. 6.1. Prototype of Object Created by Object Literal자바스크립트 엔진은 객체 리터럴을 평가해서 객체를 생성할 때 추상 연산 ObjectCreate를 호출한다. 이 때 ObjectCreate에 전달되는 프로토타입은 Object.prototype이다. 즉, 객체 리터럴에 의해 생성되는 객체의 프로토타입은 Object.prototype이다. 123456const obj = {};// 객체 리터럴에 의해 생성된 객체의 프로토타입은 Object.prototype이다.console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(obj) === Object.prototype); // true// 객체 리터럴의 생성자 함수는 Object 생성자 함수와 연결된다.console.log(obj.constructor === Object); // true 6.2. Prototype of Object Created by Object Constructor FunctionObject 생성자 함수를 호출하여 객체를 생성하면 빈 객체가 생성된다. Object 생성자 함수를 호출하면 객체 리터럴을 평가할 때와 같이 추상 연산 ObjectCeate를 호출한다. 이 때 추상 연산 ObjectCreate에 전달되는 프로토타입은 Object.prototype이다. 12345const obj = new Object;// Object 생성자 함수에 의해 생성된 객체의 프로토타입은 Object.prototype이다.console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(obj) === Object.prototype); // trueconsole.log(obj.constructor === Object); // true 6.3. Prototype of Object Created by Constructor Functionnew 연산자와 함께 생성자 함수를 호출해서 인스턴스를 생성하면 역시나 추상 연산 ObjectCreate를 호출한다. 이 때 추상 연산 ObjectCreate에 전달되는 프로토타입은 호출된 생성자 함수의 prototype 프로퍼티에 바인딩되어 있는 객체이다. 즉, 생성자 함수에 의해 생성되는 객체의 프로토타입은 생성자 함수의 prototype 프로퍼티에 바인딩된 객체이다. 123456789function Student(name) { this.name = name;}const me = new Student('Park');// 생성자 함수에 의해 생성되는 객체의 프로토타입은 생성자 함수의 prototype 프로퍼티에 바인딩된 객체이다.console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(me) === Student.prototype); // trueconsole.log(me.constructor === Student); // true 생성자 함수의 prototype 프로퍼티에 바인딩된 프로토타입 객체는 프로퍼티와 메소드를 동적으로 추가할 수 있다. 7. Prototype Chain12345678910111213function Student(name) { this.name = name;}// Student.prototype에 메소드 추가Student.prototype.callMyName = function () { console.log(`Hi! I'm ${this.name}.`);};const me = new Student('Park');console.log(me.hasOwnProperty('name')); // trueconsole.log(me.hasOwnProperty('callMyName')); // false 위의 예제에서 name 프로퍼티는 Student의 인스턴스인 me의 고유 프로퍼티이지만, callMyName은 me 프로토타입의 프로퍼티이므로 hasOwnProperty가 false를 리턴한다. 그런데 hasOwnProperty는 어느 객체의 메소드인데 별다른 정의 없이 호출할 수 있는 것일까? hasOwnProperty는 Object.prototype의 메소드로, 모든 객체가 Object.prototype을 상속하므로 호출할 수 있다. 조금 복잡해보이는 me 객체, me 객체의 prototype, Object.prototype의 관계를 그림으로 표현하면 아래와 같다. 자바스크립트 엔진은 객체의 프로퍼티에 접근하려고 할 때 해당 객체에서 우선 프로퍼티를 검색하고, 없으면 __proto__ 접근자 프로퍼티가 가리키는 프로토타입 객체의 프로퍼티를 순차적으로 검색한다. 이렇게 연결된 프로토타입들을 프로토타입 체인이라고 한다. 프로토타입 체인은 자바스크립트가 객체 지향 프로그래밍의 상속을 구현하는 메커니즘이다. 프로토타입 체인의 최상위에 위치하는 객체는 언제나 Object.prototype이다. Object.prototype을 프로토 타입 체인의 종점(End ofprototype chain)이라고 한다. Object.prototype의 [[Prototype]]에 __proto__로 접근하면 null이다. 프로퍼티 체인의 끝까지 올라가 검색했는데도 프로퍼티를 찾지 못 할 경우 에러가 아니라 undefined를 리턴한다. 식별자의 검색은 함수의 중첩 관계로 이루어진 스코프의 계층적인 구조에서 이루어지고, 프로퍼티의 검색은 객체 간의 상속 관계로 이루어진 프로토타입의 계층적인 구조에서 이루어진다. 8. Static Property/MethodStatic 프로퍼티(메소드 포함)는 생성자 함수로 인스턴트를 생성하지 않아도 참조하거나 호출할 수 있는 프로퍼티를 말한다. Static 메소드 내부에는 this를 쓸 필요가 없다. 1234567891011121314151617// Constructor Functionfunction Student(name) { this.name = name;}Student.staticProp = 'static property';Student.staticMethod = function () { console.log('static method');};Student.staticProp; // 'static property'Student.staticMethod(); // 'static method'const me = new Student('Park');me.staticMethod(); // Uncaught TypeError: me.staticMethod is not a function Student 생성자 함수는 객체이므로 자신의 프로퍼티와 메소드를 소유할 수 있다. 생성자 함수가 소유한 프로퍼티와 메소드를 정적 프로퍼티, 정적 메소드(Static property, method)라고 부른다. Static 프로퍼티와 메소드는 생성자 함수가 생성한 인스턴스로는 참조하거나 호출할 수 없다. 이는 프로토타입 체인을 이해하고 있다면 당연한 결과이다. 위 예제에서 인스턴스 객체 me가 프로퍼티를 검색하는 프로토타입 체인에는 Student의 staticProp와 staticMethod()가 없기 때문이다. 프로토타입 객체에 정의되어있는 메소드를 Prototype Method, 생성자 함수에 정의되어있는 메소드를 Static Method라고 한다. 8. Property Existance Check : in Operatorin 연산자는 객체 내에 프로퍼티가 존재하는지 확인해 Boolean 값을 반환한다. 12345678const student = { name: 'Park', grade: '3'};console.log('name' in student); // trueconsole.log('grade' in student); // trueconsole.log('address' in student); // false in 연산자는 확인의 대상이 되는 객체 (student)의 프로퍼티 뿐만 아니라 그 객체가 상속받은 모든 프로토타입의 프로퍼티를 확인한다. 그 객체의 고유 프로퍼티만 검색하고 싶다면 Object.hasOwnProperty(prototype)을 사용한다. 9. Property Enumeration객체의 모든 프로퍼티를 순회하려면 for…in 문을 사용한다. for…in 문은 프로퍼티를 열거할 때 순서를 보장하지 않는다. 1234567891011121314const student = { name: 'Park', grade: '3', address: 'Seoul', age: 22};for (const prop in student) { console.log(`${prop}: ${student[prop]}`);}// name: Park,// grade: 3,// address: Seoul,// age: 22 for…in 문은 객체의 프로퍼티 개수만큼 반복해서 prop에 student의 프로퍼티를 할당한다. in 연산자와 마찬가지로 순회 대상 객체의 프로퍼티 뿐만 아니라 객체가 상속받은 모든 프로토타입의 프로퍼티를 열거한다. 그러나 왜 Object.prototype의 프로퍼티들은 열거되지 않았을까? Object.prototype의 프로퍼티들의 프로퍼티 어트리뷰트 [[Enumarable]]의 값이 false로, 열거할 수 없도록 정의된 프로퍼티이기 때문이다. 배열에는 for…in 문 대신 일반적인 for문이나 for…of, Array.prototype.forEach 메소드를 사용하는 게 좋다. 10. Disallow use of Object.prototypes builtins directlyESLint: no-prototype-builtins ECScript 5.1에서 Object.create가 도입되면서 특정한 [[Prototype]]을 지정하여 객체를 생성할 수 있게 되었다. 123const parent = { a: 1 };// parent 객체를 상속받는 child 객체를 생성한다.const child = Object.create(parent); 그러나 만약 Object.create()의 argument를 null로 호출할 경우 생성된 객체는 프로토타입 체인에 홀로 존재하게 된다. 즉, Object.prototype의 메소드에 접근할 수 없다. 123456789const obj = Object.create(null);console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(obj)); // null// obj가 Object.prototype을 상속받지 않았으므로 obj.hasOwnProperty는 undefined이다.obj.hasOwnProperty('bar'); // TypeError: obj.hasOwnProperty is not a function// Object.prototype의 static method를 호출하였으므로 정상 호출된다.Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(obj, 'bar'); // false 게다가 Object.prototype을 상속한 객체라고 할지라도 자신의 고유 메소드로 Object.prototype의 builtin 메소드를 overriding 할 수 있다. 이를 자바스크립트에서는 Property Shadowing이라고 한다. C++에서는 Polymorphism을 구현하는 방식이 상속받은 객체의 overriding이다. Object.prototype의 builtin 메소드를 인스턴스에서 재정의한 경우에도 의도치 않은 동작이 발생할 수 있으니, Object.prototype의 builtin 메소드는 Object.prototype의 static 메소드로서 호출하는 것이 좋다.","link":"/2019/05/12/18-JavaScript-Prototype/"}],"tags":[{"name":"OOP","slug":"OOP","link":"/tags/OOP/"},{"name":"ADT","slug":"ADT","link":"/tags/ADT/"},{"name":"Encapsulation","slug":"Encapsulation","link":"/tags/Encapsulation/"},{"name":"Abstraction","slug":"Abstraction","link":"/tags/Abstraction/"},{"name":"JavaScript","slug":"JavaScript","link":"/tags/JavaScript/"},{"name":"immutable","slug":"immutable","link":"/tags/immutable/"},{"name":"mutable","slug":"mutable","link":"/tags/mutable/"},{"name":"primitive","slug":"primitive","link":"/tags/primitive/"},{"name":"object","slug":"object","link":"/tags/object/"},{"name":"pass by reference","slug":"pass-by-reference","link":"/tags/pass-by-reference/"},{"name":"pass by value","slug":"pass-by-value","link":"/tags/pass-by-value/"},{"name":"Programming","slug":"Programming","link":"/tags/Programming/"},{"name":"Computational Thinking","slug":"Computational-Thinking","link":"/tags/Computational-Thinking/"},{"name":"Scope","slug":"Scope","link":"/tags/Scope/"},{"name":"Object","slug":"Object","link":"/tags/Object/"},{"name":"window","slug":"window","link":"/tags/window/"},{"name":"TIL","slug":"TIL","link":"/tags/TIL/"},{"name":"HTML, CSS","slug":"HTML-CSS","link":"/tags/HTML-CSS/"},{"name":"ECMA","slug":"ECMA","link":"/tags/ECMA/"},{"name":"Node.js","slug":"Node-js","link":"/tags/Node-js/"},{"name":"Web Browser","slug":"Web-Browser","link":"/tags/Web-Browser/"},{"name":"Polymorphisim","slug":"Polymorphisim","link":"/tags/Polymorphisim/"},{"name":"Inheritance","slug":"Inheritance","link":"/tags/Inheritance/"},{"name":"Variable","slug":"Variable","link":"/tags/Variable/"},{"name":"Hoisting","slug":"Hoisting","link":"/tags/Hoisting/"},{"name":"Python","slug":"Python","link":"/tags/Python/"},{"name":"C","slug":"C","link":"/tags/C/"},{"name":"Call by Value","slug":"Call-by-Value","link":"/tags/Call-by-Value/"},{"name":"Call by Reference","slug":"Call-by-Reference","link":"/tags/Call-by-Reference/"},{"name":"Call by Object Reference","slug":"Call-by-Object-Reference","link":"/tags/Call-by-Object-Reference/"},{"name":"Algorithm","slug":"Algorithm","link":"/tags/Algorithm/"},{"name":"Substring","slug":"Substring","link":"/tags/Substring/"},{"name":"Subsequence","slug":"Subsequence","link":"/tags/Subsequence/"},{"name":"Fisrt-class Function","slug":"Fisrt-class-Function","link":"/tags/Fisrt-class-Function/"},{"name":"javaScript","slug":"javaScript","link":"/tags/javaScript/"},{"name":"global variable","slug":"global-variable","link":"/tags/global-variable/"},{"name":"local variavble","slug":"local-variavble","link":"/tags/local-variavble/"},{"name":"Class","slug":"Class","link":"/tags/Class/"},{"name":"Access Modifier","slug":"Access-Modifier","link":"/tags/Access-Modifier/"},{"name":"Recursion","slug":"Recursion","link":"/tags/Recursion/"},{"name":"Quick sort","slug":"Quick-sort","link":"/tags/Quick-sort/"},{"name":"First-class object","slug":"First-class-object","link":"/tags/First-class-object/"},{"name":"일급 객체","slug":"일급-객체","link":"/tags/일급-객체/"},{"name":"this","slug":"this","link":"/tags/this/"},{"name":"Number","slug":"Number","link":"/tags/Number/"},{"name":"Math","slug":"Math","link":"/tags/Math/"},{"name":"Date","slug":"Date","link":"/tags/Date/"},{"name":"String","slug":"String","link":"/tags/String/"},{"name":"Wrapper","slug":"Wrapper","link":"/tags/Wrapper/"},{"name":"Data Type","slug":"Data-Type","link":"/tags/Data-Type/"},{"name":"Expression","slug":"Expression","link":"/tags/Expression/"},{"name":"Statement","slug":"Statement","link":"/tags/Statement/"},{"name":"Operater","slug":"Operater","link":"/tags/Operater/"},{"name":"Prototype","slug":"Prototype","link":"/tags/Prototype/"}],"categories":[{"name":"Computer Engineering","slug":"Computer-Engineering","link":"/categories/Computer-Engineering/"},{"name":"JavaScript","slug":"JavaScript","link":"/categories/JavaScript/"},{"name":"Data Structure","slug":"Computer-Engineering/Data-Structure","link":"/categories/Computer-Engineering/Data-Structure/"},{"name":"TIL","slug":"TIL","link":"/categories/TIL/"},{"name":"git","slug":"git","link":"/categories/git/"},{"name":"Algorithm","slug":"Algorithm","link":"/categories/Algorithm/"},{"name":"CodeWars","slug":"Algorithm/CodeWars","link":"/categories/Algorithm/CodeWars/"},{"name":"Basic","slug":"Computer-Engineering/Basic","link":"/categories/Computer-Engineering/Basic/"},{"name":"LeetCode","slug":"Algorithm/LeetCode","link":"/categories/Algorithm/LeetCode/"},{"name":"Python","slug":"Python","link":"/categories/Python/"},{"name":"Algorithm","slug":"Computer-Engineering/Algorithm","link":"/categories/Computer-Engineering/Algorithm/"},{"name":"HTML/CSS","slug":"HTML-CSS","link":"/categories/HTML-CSS/"},{"name":"UnderScore","slug":"Algorithm/UnderScore","link":"/categories/Algorithm/UnderScore/"}]}
